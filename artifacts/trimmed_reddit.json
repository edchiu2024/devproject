        "title": "Reddit's IPO - The most important details &amp; red flags",
        "selftext": "It has been a while since there was an exciting IPO, but finally, there is one. \n\nI went through the Reddit prospectus, and here's my summary of Reddit as a company, the IPO, and some of the red flags I saw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe post will be divided into the following segments:\n\n**- Current business model**\n\n\\- **Future business model**\n\n\\- **Analysis of financial statements**\n\n\\- **Why IPO?**\n\n**- The IPO strategy**\n\n**- Sam Altman**\n\n**- Valuation**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current business model**\n\nReddit's primary revenue source is - advertising. In 2023, it accounted for 98% of the $804 million in revenue. The remaining 2% comes from Reddit premium subscriptions, as well as products within the user economy (Reddit Gold / Avatars).\n\nGiven the significance of the advertising revenue stream, let's focus on that. The simple formula that can be derived is: **Number of users** multiplied by **Average revenue per user**. \n\nThese are the two most important numbers that any investor needs to focus on when analyzing almost any advertising business.\n\nLet's start with the number of users. In an ideal world, we should know the exact number of users, and divide that with the potential user size. This will allow us to calculate the so-called \"penetration rate\". So, if the penetration rate is 10% for example, it indicates that the company has plenty of room to grow.\n\nReddit discloses two metrics: DAUq (Daily active uniques) and WAUq (Weekly active uniques). This could be seen as the first red flag. Here's why:\n\nIf we define the market size as users who are above the age of 14, that's over 270 million in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. daily active uniques are 36 million. Hence, if we use these metrics, the penetration rate is about **13%**.\n\nHowever, if we use the weekly active uniques, we get to a penetration rate of almost **50%** (131 million WAUq).\n\nSo, which one is it?\n\nI'll argue that even the 50% is understated. Why? Because first of all, not everyone will be on Reddit, just as not everyone will be on any other platform. Second of all, there are users who use Reddit once every few months, when they need someone's advice or opinion. These, once in a while users are not taken into these metrics.\n\nIn theory, the company can innovate, and bring new features, that attract more users, and the average time spent per user increases. Given that the platform doesn't change too much over time, I'll argue that the platform applies only to a certain type of user and is getting close to the ceiling when it comes to growing within the U.S.\n\nInternationally, on the other side, there is plenty of room to grow. However, as George Orwell said, \"All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others\".\n\nThis brings us to the 2nd part of the equation - average revenue per user.\n\nThe average U.S. user brings 4x more revenue than the average user from the rest of the world. So, although there is room to grow, it is less valuable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Future business model**\n\nThis is a good short summary of Reddit's main income stream, but it is backward-looking, and there is one more thing that we need to take into account. Its data.\n\nIt is fair to say that the platform is one of the internet's largest archives of human experiences and conversations, and this data definitely has value. It can be used for various reasons, including, training large language models. Pretty much the same day as filing the prospectus, Reddit and Google announced a partnership, that is expected to be worth $60 million per year. This is 8% of its 2023 revenue and I believe this revenue stream - licensing data - is what will create all the hype around the company. \n\nHere's why I think that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Analysis of financial statements**\n\nDespite being around for 19 years, Reddit is still struggling to find its way to profitability and loses around $100m per year. It can be argued that the company is poorly managed, and it reminds me of Twitter prior to the acquisition of Elon Musk, when the R&amp;D was incredibly high and couldn't be justified with the new features introduced by the platform.\n\nReddit's R&amp;D for 2023 was $438 million (55% of revenue). Of course, this is lagging, as in many cases, the value created from it is somewhere in the future. However, this isn't something new. Reddit has historically had high R&amp;D expenses. Whether this is justified or not, of course, you be the judge.\n\nIts revenue growth in 2023 was 20%, which isn't too exciting and can be barely labeled as a growth company. Especially considering there's not much room to grow in the U.S. and its international growth is less valuable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe expectation is that the valuation will be above $5 billion. The company has over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and no debt apart from leases. Meaning, that the valuation of the business is above $3.8 billion. \n\nI'd argue with the current business model and lack of profitability, this cannot be justified. Its future value is highly dependent on the success of data licensing, a revenue stream, that we have very little information on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why IPO?**\n\nHowever, the question \"Why IPO?\" has not been answered yet. The company is losing $100m per year and has over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. This is sufficient to cover the losses for the foreseeable future. So, raising additional funds doesn't seem to be the main reason for the IPO.\n\nTwo reasons should be considered:\n\n1. **Liquidity for the existing shareholders** \\-  However, if the existing shareholders are pushing for this, it means they're not too optimistic about the company's future.\n2. Executive compensation - The CEO, for example, has over 660k PRSUs (Performance-restricted share units) that are eligible to vest when the company attains a $5b market cap valuation.\n\nIn my opinion, if the current shareholders believe in the company, they would be better off if the company remained private. So far, I am not convinced that the IPO adds any value to the company.\n\nBeing a public company brings quite some costs. The list of all costs, that is disclosed in the prospectus is yet to be completed, and there are also going to be additional ongoing expenses for being a public company, that will be incurred every single year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The IPO strategy**\n\nThe price of pretty much anything is a function of supply and demand. As Reddit doesn't need additional funds, I don't expect the company will issue too many additional shares. Rumors range from raising $100m to $750m. Now, if we focus on the demand, here's another red flag.\n\nQualified Reddit users and moderators will be invited to buy shares in the IPO, alongside other investors, through a directed share program. In my opinion, this is a psychological trick, making the users and moderators feel special so that they use this special offer to buy shares.\n\nIn addition, there will be shares offered through Fidelity Brokerage Services, SoFi, and Robinhood. So, if someone wants to buy into an IPO, they get a chance to do that. Basically, the goal is to increase demand as much as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sam Altman**\n\nEntities affiliated with Sam Altman have 9.2% voting power. Yes, the  OpenAI Sam Altman.\n\nHave you seen the licensing deal between OpenAI and Reddit?  \nMe neither.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation**\n\nAnyway, one of the questions that many have is - Is Reddit going to be overvalued from the start? The answer to that question depends on your expectations for the data licensing model. Based on my estimates, the current advertising business model is worth around $1.7 billion.\n\nAdd the $1.2 billion of cash on top of it, and the valuation is close to $3 billion.\n\nOf course, I could be wrong in my estimates, but it is quite clear that the advertising business doesn't explain the $5 billion + valuation.\n\nSo, is the data licensing revenue stream worth more than $2 billion? This is one of the main questions that needs to be answered. As there is no past information, it is also the key piece of the puzzle to create hype around the company. I would not be surprised if more data licensing information followed before the IPO, which further increases the hype around the company.\n\nHowever, if Reddit can land many data licensing deals, then the $5 billion valuation can be justified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love to read your thoughts about the IPO, your thoughts on how much the data licensing stream is worth, as well as if there is something else that you find important, that I missed.",

        "title": "Apple Met With DOJ Antitrust Chief in Last-Ditch Bid to Avoid Expected Suit",
        "selftext": "# Apple Met With DOJ Antitrust Chief in Last-Ditch Bid to Avoid Expected Suit\n\n(Bloomberg) -- **Apple Inc. representatives met with the Justice Department last week in a final bid to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the company**, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe company and its lawyers met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who will make the final call on whether to file a suit, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential meeting. Such \u201clast rites\u201d meetings are often one of the final steps before a lawsuit is filed.\n\nAntitrust enforcers, who have been probing the company since 2019, allege that Apple has imposed software and hardware limitations on its iPhones and iPads to impede rivals from effectively competing. The suit is expected in the coming weeks, likely by the end of March, the people said.\n\nApple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nApple\u2019s App Store, which charges developers a commission of either 15% or 30%, has come under heavy criticism by developers and lawmakers.\n\nIn January, Apple said it will allow US developers to use alternative payment systems, but charge a 27% fee for most digital purchases or 12% on subscriptions. Epic Games Inc., which sued the company over its App Store policies, is contesting the proposed changes, saying they are inadequate and would effectively prevent developers from reducing consumer prices.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state was in touch with the Justice Department about the potential case and could join onto an eventual complaint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very interested in\u201d possibly joining, Bonta said. \u201cWe are very aware of the federal government\u2019s interest in Apple. We are interested also, and it\u2019s very aligned with our overall strategy in the tech industry.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has also been monitoring Apple\u2019s moves in Europe as it prepares to begin enforcing new digital gatekeeper rules on March 7.\n\nTo comply with those rules, Apple said it will allow customers to download software from outside its App Store, use alternative payment systems and more easily choose a new default web browser. Yet several developer groups have slammed Apple\u2019s proposed changes as \u201cmalicious compliance\u201d with the EU\u2019s rules, criticizing the iPhone maker for introducing new fees for payment processing and a \u20ac0.50 per app installation fee for software downloaded more than 1 million times. While Apple said most developers in the EU would see their payments decrease or stay the same, developers say the new fee will force them to stay within the App Store or face prohibitive payments.\n\nApple is expected to face a fine of at least \u20ac500 million ($542 million) by EU\u2019s antitrust watchdog as soon as next week related to allegations it silenced music-streaming rivals, including Spotify Technology SA, on its platforms. The company separately offered to settle a second probe into its tap-to-pay technologies, by opening up access to its coveted near-field communication chip on iPhones to rival digital wallets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsource;\n\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-met-with-doj-antitrust-chief-in-last-ditch-bid-to-avoid-expected-suit-1.2040085](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-met-with-doj-antitrust-chief-in-last-ditch-bid-to-avoid-expected-suit-1.2040085)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-met-with-us-justice-department-bid-avoid-antitrust-lawsuit-bloomberg-2024-02-27/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-met-with-us-justice-department-bid-avoid-antitrust-lawsuit-bloomberg-2024-02-27/)\n\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-met-justice-department-antitrust/",

        "selftext": "China\u2019s Baidu said fourth-quarter revenue rose 6%, helped by gains from its artificial intelligence applications and a growing advertising business.\n\nFor the three months through December, the company reported revenue of 34.95 billion yuan ($4.92 billion), broadly in line with analysts\u2019 average estimate of 34.97 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe company\u2019s adjusted net income rose by 44% to 7.76 billion yuan, compared with 5.37 billion yuan for the same period a year earlier, beating analysts\u2019 forecasts for 6.32 billion yuan.\n\nAs China\u2019s largest internet search engine, Baidu makes the majority of its revenue from advertising. But as China\u2019s economy slows and consumers spend less, Baidu has increasingly invested in AI. In March last year, it launched its ChatGPT-like ERNIE Bot in bid to capture from the potential of the technology.\n\nThe company said ERNIE AI services have already started to contribute to Baidu\u2019s revenues.\n\n\u201cThroughout 2023, we made significant strides in advancing ERNIE and ERNIE Bot, reinventing our products and services, and achieving breakthroughs in monetization.\u201d Co-founder and CEO Robin Li said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S.-listed shares of the company rose by 0.4% in trading before the bell.\n\nBaidu\u2019s online marketing revenue grew 6% to 19.2 billion yuan.\n\nFor the quarter, its adjusted profit was 21.86 yuan per American Depositary Share (ADS), compared with a profit of 15.25 yuan per share a year earlier.\n\nThis exceeded analysts\u2019 average estimate of 17.87 yuan per ADS, according to LSEG.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/baidu-q4-earnings-2023.html",

I either become a legend or a martyr tonight. Failure is no longer an option; the ball has hit the ground, and the only choice is to bounce back or die trying. Today we have on the menu: Snowflake, Paramount, and C3 dot ai ( dot = . (reddit makes it a link lmao))\n\n \n\n1. **SNOW** \\- If there's one thing I have learned this earnings season, it\u2019s that cloud stocks get slaughtered, whether they beat or miss earnings. Only a handful of cloud companies go up, and I am sure Snowflake isn\u2019t one of them. It\u2019s still a long way to go for Snowflake to become profitable. Take a look at their leadership; I can\u2019t see a single face that doesn\u2019t look younger than 50. This company is way overvalued as well, 77B market cap with a PE of -100??? Tonight I'm just following the trend of other cloud providers, and they all shit the bed after earnings, so I am shorting this company. Also, add to all this that Cramer is bullish on them\u2026\u2026.\n2. **PARA** \\- Paramount makes some damn good movies: Godfather, Interstellar, Top gun, TWOWS, SPR, Shutter Island, KOTFM, and many more. I went to the cinema a couple of months ago to watch the new Mission Impossible in 4DX, and I had a blast. Warren Buffett sold his PARA holdings last quarter; we all know this boomer has lost his Midas touch by now, so I am very confident coming into earnings tonight. Tbh this play comes more from the heart than from the brain.\n3. **AI** \\- Honestly, this ticker says enough. Expect green dildos tonight\n\n[NOT TODAY!!!!!!!\ud83e\udd1e](https://preview.redd.it/ttsagflv8clc1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=027fc8e223353e91dd90e08e10c2faf1766cd4c2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tldr: AI &amp; PARA go up, SNOW go down**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy positions:\n\n[Using 5x leveraged CFD\u2019s \\(europoor\\), $16.8K exposure.
