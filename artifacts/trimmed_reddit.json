It's actually causing them to reevaluate the entire cost structure .  $5 used to be a full meal deal, wither bowl, drink, and cookie, or 2 PC chicken, side, cookie, and drink, but that was 5 years ago . $3.99 for a small side means I\u2019ll never go to a KFC again. $2.49 near me is still worse than Popeyes .",

This isn\u2019t Panda Express????\u201d \"I'll take the white rice... *Scoops white rice* I said fried rice\" \"I'm doing it wrong, I wanted the fried rice,\" \"No you're doing it right\" \"There's so much stupidity that comes into panda it's laughable\"  Both panda\u2019s I\u2019ve worked at in my town are within 10 feet of a Starbucks . I once had someone come through and just yell \"ONION RINGS?\" at me over and over .  Customers ask for ketchup and bbq sauce, multiple customers ask for the chow mein to be cooked with no vegetables, i\u2019ve been asked why i work here if im not asian, i had a customer ask for sweet and sour sauce in a cup bc he refused to eat his food if it came in packet form .  Some people don't know what \"Beijing beef\" tastes like, is it spicy? Is it sweet? That could change if you want it or not . The chowmein is always literally like 80% undercooked cabbage .  There are no actual eggs in an egg roll, about half the time there are no eggs in the egg roll . I have been denied chowmein multiple times at Panda in Solana Beach because they \"ran out\" during the lunch rush .  Customers often ask if there\u2019s eggs in the egg roll or they would ask for fried rice then when their plate is finished they would say \u201cI asked for white rice.\u201d Half the time there are no actual eggs in egg rolls, it's 50/50 wether egg rolls have egg or not .  A customer asked \"can i get a plate with fried chicken , half chow mien , half noodles?\" A customer come in and asked \"do you have change of a nickel??\" Another customer asked for a refund for her cash, saying it simply isn't that hard because i Hadn\u2019t given her her change back .  An orange chicken and rice burrito, a chopped teri chicken with rice, or chopped Beijing beef and rice . You can opt for either white or fried rice. You could even go chow mein instead of rice if you want! I'd take mine with fried rice and cabbage please!  Someone asked me the difference between white and brown rice: \"Is this All Day Special still going on?\" Someone who ordered mushroom chicken with a zucchini allergy and never mentioned it on their order: \"i can\u2019t find the ice cream anywhere!\"  Customers often ask if the honey sesame chicken is spicy or spicy, but it's sweet like honey just like the names implies . One customer came in for a pick-up order only to come back in a few minutes later, angry because he \u201cOrdered fish and chips, but they came with fries instead of chips\u201d",

He's always respectful and friendly towards the staff .  An anonymous Reddit user posted a picture of a Panda Express manager and his behavior on Reddit . The anonymous user said the manager has been critical of the store's employees . He said the whole store could walk out - it won\u2019t be an issue .  There is no contract! 2 former managers have messaged me and what you\u2019re saying is a lie! I don\u2019t need misinformation and more lies to protect dictators .  The reason why they are hourly not salary is because Panda was sue for not paying managers, they were doing 40 plus hours and when they did the math they were getting paid less then associates . The company is a family own company. No investor no one else they have to listen too. They can start selling pizza tomorrow if they wanted too .  There are quite a few higher ups that don't deserve their job. They just keep getting promoted higher bc everything \"looks good\" But in reality they do what they have to, to fudge it just enough that it appears good . Disrespect, being rude, lack of empathy, and most of all power abuse is not a generational thing .  At least 2 managers and some associates who resigned because of him! Defend him all you want for all I care you might be Asian. Try calling him personally, his number is hanging in every single store . He would 100% walk towards an associate to yell at him/her I have seen it!  If they aren\u2019t in the store a lot just get over it . And if it\u2019s that bad just quit. I have seen how they are. You need to pound the living f out of them!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The wife and I like to get takeout once a week as a little date night for ourselves and today we chose Panda Express because we both love the food. \nShe ordered a bowl with Chow Mein and Orange Chicken and I got a plate of the same but with fried rice as well. The location we ordered from was close so it took no time at all going through DoorDash. Though it was at this point that our good fortune had been expunged. \nTo start, upon opening my to-go plate it seems as though this location did not have any rice available as it had carefully been removed from my plate. Oh well, I don\u2019t care I just want food. \nThe wife and I dig into our food and suddenly the room went still. I glanced up at the lady and when our eyes met, she sent my soul into fight or flight mode. Her expression was as if he had walked in on me with another woman, though she didn\u2019t move a muscle. I asked what was the matter and it turns out two things had happened:\n1. The most likely rationalization is that the staff had mixed up the regular OC with the spicy stuff. We both got the short end of this stick. \n2. When the staff had added the spices, I swear the lid came off whatever container they had used to bless our food with this sea of HEAT. \nThe wife spit out what she described as a bean sized, black pepper which caused her mouth to be sent into the fiery pits of the underworld. \nI was only thankful that I only had to experience the wrong selection of food..\nAfter all had settled down, I had finished my food and wanted to dig into my fortune, which I absolutely enjoy. Excited to see my fortune and eat my delightful cookie, I had fallen into despair. Maybe my fortune was the friends I had made along the way.. (there was nothing). Oh well.. \u2026 the cookie was burnt :(\nThe wife opened her fortune following my unfortunate turn of events. She carefully opened the cookie (everything fell on the floor).

It's a fast dish and we ain't trying to lag behind and cook it more for dishes that matter way more. The way they cook/prep them is to wash before cutting .  \"Most don't that to save time.\" However, it's a standard practice that the DMs put in place . To not only save time but to ensure the produce lasts longer in wic to save food cost .  Panda standard so vegetables last longer is to not wash the vegetables when prepping, so when they cook them all the dirt and mold goes in the water . People ate like that since the dawn of time and we survived as a human race. I think a spec of dirt ain\u2019t gonna hurt you.",

So u fumbled the interview, I guess.. could you please give me some advice going forward. Recently I went into a Panda Express and most of the employees seemed very young with not too much experience. So this is what confuses me.

Count your drawer before you begin and count money back to guests, especially if you get those new bills that stick together .

I had the string bean chicken and there was no sauce, same with my husband's beef and broccoli and Beijing beef (I don't mean sauce packets...we were given soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce packets).  Finally, is the chow mein side always mostly Chinese cabbage and onions with very little noodles?\n\nWe really wanted to like the place, and while the food wasn't terrible, there were definite problems.  On the plus side, the chicken in the string bean chicken was well cooked and tasty, the fried rice, while a little bland, wasn't bad, and Husband really liked the Beijing Beef.  Also, none of the dishes were overly salty or greasy as some Chinese food can be.\n\nThank you in advance for your answers.",

On that momen Well yesterday I went to work my last shift of the week as a back of the house. You know rice and chow maiw right.

Well on this Sunday my general manager told me that I was going to cook from 9:30 am to 5:00 pm because the cook that normally work\u2019s on Sundays had an emergency and after 5:00 pm I was going to change positions with him to do prep and help him close kitchen on the night . On that moment I agree with him because I understand the situation and I notice that we were short staffed.( oh something really important I\u2019m not a cook so I don\u2019t get pay like them I\u2019m just a back of the house, on this same week I also took my cooking tests which I fail in the cutting test but I pass everything besides that, to be honest I don\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t pass because I normally make prep 2 days on the week for almost a year and to be honest my work is not bad I will say that I\u2019m the best on that job behind the chef.) But the point in here is that when the time came he never change positions with me or helped me to close kitchen. I\u2019m just saying I work from 9:30 am to 12:00 am without getting pay from my work, with not help to close kitchen beside in some point he told me some rude comment about my performance in the kitchen. I just don\u2019t understand I only went in there to work my shift as normal. Oh one more thing he went home before me I didn\u2019t help me to make souces for the next day I literally was making sauces at 11:30 pm after closing kitchen. He also had a shift lead that has doing rice and chow maiwn. From my point of view they can also help in the kitchen. Well she didn\u2019t do nothing and even worst when she left she didn\u2019t restock nothing because when the guy of sides came on 5 was trying to catch up restocking and doing the sides on the same time.

        "selftext": "I just started about three weeks ago and so far I've only done sides. I finish closing sides usually at 11 - 11:20ish and I'm pretty comfortable with it. My closes are always decent but I'm always last one besides my manager or shift lead.\n\nToday I worked 5-close and I asked my co-worker if I could stay on dish the whole night. I finished around 11:10 while my co-worker to my dismay finished sides at around 10:30 and had time to do all my other dish tasks for me like polish the walk in. I thanked him but I couldn't help but feel I was inefficient.\n\nNot slow per say but inefficient, just from seeing other co-workers finish around 10:40 on weekends while it took me until 11:10 on a very slow Tuesday to close dish and I couldn't even do it all the way.\n\nAny tips or pointers to make me the fastest and most effective dish washer? I really enjoyed being able to go use the bathroom or get a drink without interruption.",
