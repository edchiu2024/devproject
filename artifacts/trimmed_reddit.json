        "selftext": "Background: I am a 3rd party seller who sells private label goods on Amazon. I gross annually between $1-2mil in revenue. At first many sellers and I kind of brushed off this new policy change that was initiated on March 1st, 2024. However once digging deeper into it and making shipments to send into Amazon, I realized how much of a vulture Amazon truly is. As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&amp;ref=nslp\\_at\\_33\\_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5\\_en-US\\_ttl\\_rf\\_recent\\_news\\_34https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/\r  \n\r  \nAnalysis:\r  \n\r  \nAmazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:\r  \n\r  \nExpansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.\r  \n\r  \n\"Voluntary\" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:\n\n\\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.\r  \n\r  \nImplementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:\r  \n\r  \n\\- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean\u2014to avoid excessive storage fees\u2014now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.\r  \n\r  \nThis policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of \"low inventory\" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the \"voluntary\" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*Overall Financial Impact:\\*\\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.\r  \n\r  \nBonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.\r  \n\r  \nExtra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.\r  \n\r  \nPosition: 20% of my portfolio is now in AMZN. Even at ATH, I plan to change to 50% weighted in Amazon... This is pissing me off, but I gotta find a way to get my money back somehow.",

        "summarized_comments": " The 5th largest company in the world by market cap is going to be successful . The internet exploded between 1994 and 2000 . Only 3 out of the top 10 in 2000 continued to go up while 7 of the 10 cratered .  The bidding process could be inflated, but Amazon does not tell you what the bid for each position is . If these bids left unchecked, it could go crazy really quick . The way companies handle this auction dynamic is to figure out what's the real bid range and then suggest bids on the lower end of that range .  Some of the stuff I read on Reddit is crazy. Even if it's ATH today, it's still cheap IMHO. It's also too small of a share of the overall revenue to have a large impact. I am way overweight on AMZN, and for several reasons think I should reduce my stake. I keep expecting them to announce some kind of splitting off of AWS, and don't want to miss out on the resulting spike when they do.  Amazon's rapacious conduct and philosophy is not something I want to do business with, but is something I expected to show up as EPS . Amazon actually loses money when an item is sold and fulfilled by Amazon . OP got lucky selling 3rd rate Chinese junk on Amazon and now thinks he's an expert stock analyst . The cost will most likely be passed onto the consumer and further worsen inflation .",

        "selftext": "It seems to me that among the recent Gemini headlines (which I find personally quite overblown, as Meta\u2019s very advanced AI displayed the same flaws, and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot was shown to display some real nonsense as well), people have kind of lost track of the autonomous vehicle business. \n\nWaymo is by far the most advanced technology of all autonomous vehicle companies in existence. I\u2019m not sure if people are fully aware that Waymo already has a commercial driverless taxi service in operation. I haven\u2019t tried it but watched videos and it seems to work amazingly well. People love to nitpick autonomous vehicles and say \u201coh x and y are not working perfectly well\u201d, but let\u2019s be real, human taxi drivers are far from perfect and the service seems to be working far, far better than the average taxi driver. This week, Waymo received approval to run their commercial service in Los Angeles. \n\nWhile most carmakers dabble in their own autonomous driving technology, many of them also have collaborations with Waymo. I see real potential for Waymo to become the de facto provider for most carmakers - the way that for years, many parallel charging networks existed, and very suddenly the majority of carmakers signed on to Tesla\u2019s solution as the dominos kept falling one after the other. \n\nWith all the news around ChatGPT, most investors seem to use \u201cAI\u201d interchangeably with \u201cchatbot\u201d or more generally \u201cLLM\u201d or \u201cimage generation\u201d. But autonomous driving is in fact AI as well.\n\nGoogle also owns Deepmind which has been at the absolute cutting edge for AI for many years now. I feel like most people overlook this because you can\u2019t just go to Deepmind.com and have a conversation with their AI. But they are doing some incredibly advanced stuff in scientific fields. Monetizing all of that is going to be a different story but I feel that from a technology standpoint, Google is very much doing impressive things:\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/29/1084061/deepmind-ai-tool-for-new-materials-discovery/amp/\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-04043-w",

San Francisco is one of the worst cities to drive due to the fog and all the hills blocking your view when you try to turn .  Waymo would be amazing in a short-laboured country like Japan . The taxi drivers there are mostly over 45 years old . Car accidents are always going to happen no matter how good autonomous driving gets . Capping liability for a giant corporation is bound to be unpopular .  Waymo is not even *remotely* close to L5 but is operating driverless taxis at least in 3 cities right now . Society will eventually get over the danger of automated taxis like they do with everything . We just need to get used to the idea that a machine killing one is better than a human killing 10 .  It needs to more reliably hand off the query to assistant instead of doing a search . The last update made the mic button strictly for search and the side button for assistant . It means that Google under Pichai management imposed heavy censorship .  The stock market loves this kind of shit10 times..lol. The fact that Alphabet's fwd p/e is \\~17 times is pretty silly.yeah if their CEO would just accuse a rescuer of being a pedophile, go smoke weed on Joe Rogan, and pay off a woman after trying to offer to buy a horse in exchange for sex, they would probably 10x.  Waymo is in fact currently in commercial use without being perfected . Waymo could probably generate billions of revenue if they license their software . However I don't think it's nearly as rosy an outlook for Waymo as some might think . Google is undervalued stock if you want to hold it long term .  Self-driving was never interesting for me. It has lost Google a lot of money. I use Microsoft CoPilot daily as a replacement for Google search for 95% of my use cases . Google should stick to something that has a good cost to benefit ratio. Something with high gross margins .  Waymo has been around for a decade and barely brings in any revenue . It's included in their Other Bets revenue which doesn't even bring in 1B a quarter . Companies arent going to try to develop their own self driving cars .  Waymo exists in 3 geofenced cities and doesn\u2019t get on highways, it is not the most advanced autonomous driving software . The most driving data and driverless miles by an order of magnitude, not geofencing, vertical integration and the capital to keep going . Tesla isn't even close to the capabilities of a non-geofenced competitor .  The upfront cost of the car is obviously unimportant . It runs 24x7, and theyll get the cost down to normal car levels anyway, making it several times more cost effective than an uber human owning a car . The only cost that looks difficult to me is the service centres .  It works on every street, anywhere in the world, on any Tesla and will by licenseable to any manufacturer . It runs on a car that cost $25k to manufacture (and soon less) while it cost Waymo 200k to get a car out there .",

Comparisons to Starbucks without any mention on international expansion makes this a potentially misleading comparison . The company isn't how it used to be .  The Dutch Bros. stock is not a VIE in any way, shape or form . The company divided its share ownership into \"founder,\" \"management,\" and \"sponsor\" Pre-IPO, you can see that they divided their share ownership . After the IPO, you now have different classes of common stock .  The biggest question is where they\u2019re going to be in 5-10 years . Their products are not groundbreaking or innovative so I don't see their ability to find untapped growth sectors or modes of production/sales that haven't been done before . Dutch Bros cancelled their franchising model, which means they will never be able to grow beyond the current levels .  The beverage market is projected to expand another 20% overall by the end of the decade . Dutch Bros has made a really targeted effort to market towards younger millennial and Gen z\u2019ers with not just coffee, but other drink options .  If you're only looking at the US stocks than you will bump into the same problem . Coca-Cola is the second largest coffee chain in the world and made $307m in profits . Dutch Bros trades at 989x earnings, which is very high, but they\u2019re so small .  Their coffee tastes like hot garbage and if you get a specialty drink it is way too sweet .

        "title": "SMCI - My BEAR case",
        "selftext": "I have been hearing a lot of buzz around SMCI lately and there is a lot of chatter about it being put into the S&amp;P at the next rebalance (snapshot date is this upcoming Friday, 08 March 2024 and implement date is the following Friday after close I believe.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am going to make my bear case for this stock by not looking at fundamentals at all and only using basic rebalance principles.  Since the vast majority of Americans have their money passively flowing into these broad indices and not caring about the specific underlying stocks anyways, I think it is only fitting to remove fundamental company analysis entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs it stands, SMCI is trading at $905.48 and has a market cap of $50.65 billion USD.\r  \n\r  \nCurrently, SMCI is trading in the Russell 2000 (RUT). It is the highest cap stock in the RUT by about 3x. This disparity is why I believe that joining the S&amp;P 500 is a death sentence to the stock price, and the downwards pressure and volatility will happen extremely quickly once it is added. I will explain why.\r  \n\r  \nThe majority of investors nowadays invest their money passively through retirement accounts/401k's or just are told that their money is safer if you put it into ETFs. This results in a MASSIVE amount of inflow into a basket of stocks without much/any DD discerning the individual stocks in the basket. As for market cap weighted indices/ETFs, the percentage of that index is based on the market cap of the stock.\r  \n\r  \nIf I put $1,000 into the RUT, as it currently stands, $1.62 of that will be towards SMCI, while the next highest stock, MSTR, will receive $0.51. As SMCI increases in market cap, even more of the inflow into the RUT will get pumped passively into SMCI. This is a self-perpetuating cycle of inflow into the highest capped stock(s) in the index.\r  \n\r  \nNow onto the S&amp;P 500. I am going to compare SMCI to 3M, which has a market cap of $50.77 billion and is currently sitting in the S&amp;P 500. 3M is weighted to 0.12% of the entire S&amp;P, meaning it receives approximately 0.12% of the inflow. If SMCI enters into the S&amp;P, I expect it to receive about the same, 0.12% inflow. Now looking at the daily volume of SPY (S&amp;P ETF) vs IWM (RUT ETF), there is about 5.5x the flow of SPY vs. IWM, meaning SPY gets 5.5x more money going through it daily.\r  \n\r  \nDoing some quick math off this, SMCI is currently sitting at an inflow of 1.62%(IWM) and will turn into 0.12%(SPY). Turning the units of SPY into IWM, we multiply the 0.12 by 5.5, so 0.12%(SPY)\\*5.5(SPY)/(IWM) nets us 0.65%(IWM).\r  \n\r  \nThe ratio of inflow into SMCI immediately after it enters the S&amp;P will be 0.65/1.62\\*100 = 40% of what it is currently getting while outperforming in the RUT.\r  \n\r  \nThis tells me that the inflow into SMCI is going to take a 60% decline overnight as soon as it gets put into the S&amp;P. Obviously there are other factors and the RUT is not the only ETF or fund trading SMCI right now, but the underlying argument still stands that the inflow is going to be GREATLY reduced instantaneously, likely causing a massive shock to the stock price.\r  \n\r  \nThis same calculation can be used on other over or underperforming stocks in their indices if they are set to jump from one index to another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to argue me on this one if you disagree with me!",

The company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 23.5 indicates a reasonable valuation relative to its growth prospects. With a trailing twelve months (TTM) return on equity (ROE) of approximately 14%, it also demonstrates efficient utilization of shareholder equity. Moreover, its debt-to-equity ratio of about 0.33 suggests a healthy balance sheet, conducive to sustainable growth. IMO the healthcare sector's projected stable long term growth and the company's strong financial indicators, I believe AMN Healthcare is well-positioned for long-term success in the healthcare staffing industry. What do you guys think?",

The old iPods make great sound, but they don't even have the ability to charge anymore . The old ones can swap a battery swap, switch out the hard drive for an SSD, and install custom firmware . The only thing not included was batteries .  No one really needs a new phone if they've had one from the past 5-10 years . They don't do anything inherently different that people actually need so it's mostly based on marketing and Apple withholding something from you so you upgrade .  It's a joke and doubt it ever works for non-paying customers . You wouldn't backup reddit. Like reddit, you wouldn't back up reddit. But yes, Immich works wonders .  Apple's iCloud storage is full, says Reddit user . Time Machine backups will include iPhone backups . Users can turn off features using iCloud to store/back up data to it .  Apple has been trading nearly sideways for 2 years . The company's stock market has been down for two years . Apple is set to launch a 5G version of the iPhone 5S with 5G, but that's not enough .  Apple is all about milking the shit out of customers, there\u2019s no way they\u2019d hand out 50GB for their billion users . That would be 50 million terabytes that they would have to fund . A lot of people won't use all of the extra space .  It used to be possible to back up to your computer. They took it away. Now there\u2019s no alternative to iCloud backups. You have to use it and they don\u2019t give you enough iCloud storage, so you have to pay for more storage . I just use it to backup my website records so I can access those things from anywhere .  The legal system is so stupid. You can sign up for 95% of class action settlements with no proof... The lawyers do all the work to make these lawsuits happen for free precisely because it pays off when they win without that individuals would either have to collectively pay for representation or sue individually .  If it takes a lawsuit to force Apple to open things up, I'm, all for it and on board . Why is moving photos and videos out of your iPhone so damn hard and unintuitive?  Apple is getting fleeced for paying $2.99/month for 50gb of storage on iCloud . The majority of Apple users by far are fine with paying higher prices .  Apple seems too big to fail right now but don\u2019t underestimate what could happen in the next 2-3 years . The thing that annoys me the most about icloud is how stored imessages are double counted if you have multiple devices .  Arbitration clauses can go very very poorly for companies because having a million people going through arbitration where you have to pay for each  and every arbitration plus any damages awarded can easily rack up hundreds of millions .",

Google should probably ensure Gemini has access to people's web cams and only support those who fit the DEI narrative . It's best to instill a Victimizer/Victimized relationships into our AI and disproportionately and indiscriminately apply bias .  There is a lot of untapped potential in using YouTube videos to train AI, I don't think any of that is on archive.org. They also have tremendous user data in the form of browsing habits, app usage on android etc . YouTube data is a gold mine. It\u2019s too bad they can\u2019t get out of their own way .  The world will be AI and AI will perfect the art of selling us shit we don't need . But wouldn\u2019t Google, the king of information, be in a great position to capitalize on AI? Everyone is assuming they are just going to not advance anymore as a company .  Google invented the current AI approach everyone's using with the transformer back in 2017 . It's not the stupid image generator that is holding it back it's other policies on its Ai . Google will change some of their Ai policies. It's apparently really really good but policy makes it barely compete .  There is active caste discrimination at MSFT and GOOG. It\u2019s a huge problem and many agree one of the reasons google is risking to succeed and will be left behind . The middle of the company is ran by a culture based on your name and family tree .  The negative Google news reminds me of Meta when it tanked (and then came back) Google's AI was developed to be extremely \"woke\" to the point where it is factually inaccurate and unreliable . Google\u2019s problems run deep, and I\u2019m worried they revealed exactly who they are with this Gemini debacle .  The problem with Google\u2019s culture is that it doesn\u2019t allow for self-correction very easily . Decision making is famously done by multi-stakeholder consensus and changing that will be nearly impossible without significant change at the top . Google searches are damn near worthless at this point, I trust Reddit search results more .  Nvidia is has better social sentiment and momentum than both Apple and Google combined right now . People shorting the greatest consumer internet company of all time because of some paranoia about it being too \u201cwoke\u201d ought to stop trading .  Google has a good chance of losing the AI race, but it's a long time hold for me personally and I'm buying more . I have a large position and I\u2019m giving them another quarter to pretend that they can still compete with AI . I still feel like we\u2019re getting a pump this week up to 142-145 and then falling off to 130 .",

They pay the same role in this case as an attorney would if someone rear ended you and they sued their insurance company .  Nothing should be paid until the board make a final decision on how much Musk will be compensated . The value of Tesla has increased over 10x from when the pay package was approved . The demand for compensation for value returned to shareholders is 10% .  Lawyers get like 33% on personal injury cases, but 10% for saving shareholders $50B in value seems a bit low . No law firm should get a new drug patent payday for winning any case . No one ever sues for exactly what they are owed .  Tesla just gives Musk less stock this go around, but not $50 billion less . Paying them would tank the stock price by significantly more than 60b . Tesla would benefit from a different ceo now, and not immune to sec regulation .  The legal system allows for lawyers in a case to do everything twice, and there are hearings on briefs, on depositions, on sworn complaints, etc. Everything is done multiple times, it costs $450 per hour, and even a one sentence text message is billed at .1 hours (6 minutes) at a cost of $45 .  The last time I had to deal with one of those vermin creatures, it was I who had to tell him specifically what to do and write, and the parasite was still charging me at the rate of one hour per sentence . If it took them originally 5 hours to write but they are able to edit it for multiple uses should they not be compensated for their knowledge?  Tesla CEO Elon Musk sued Tesla for $6 billion . Lawyer fees are $248k per hour . Musk's attention is worth the money . Lawyers brought this lawsuit to enrich themselves .  Elon should sue these ass clowns to get the company he was found guilty of extorting to pay the lawyers that sued him for it . He has so much reach and capital, and now, after he has lost two large cases in the last couple months (where he was forced to buy Twitter when he didn\u2019t want to and then when his pay package was voided), he will suddenly use said reach to try and get .

Two identical cars can have wildly different interest rates .  This is not financial advice, it's all subjective from having experienced them first hand . The way I see it, they're a trash stock but they'll keep getting pumped from the banks, I wouldn't consider it a long term investment .  Carvana bought out my way upside down lease and made me 10k on top . How do you get upside down on a lease? \"How do you make 10K on something you are upside down?\" \"It\u2019s vehicle arbitrage\"  At the end of 3yrs you can buy the car for more or you give it back . There isn't a lease contract on Earth that forces you to buy it . You can't be under water on a lease, you don't even own the car .  Carvana almost went bankrupt because they were making zero profit on all those cars, and taking a loss on quite a few as well . They were trying to expand and eat up a ton of market space so they were offering outrageous amounts to get their hands on every car they possibly could . Carvana has made fundamental changes to their business and cost .  The house of cards for them will crash down eventually.

Carvana is known to pay the most for trade ins and also a lower price on the sale side compared to competitors . Yet they claim a 5k per car sold gross margin when the industry is between 1.5k to 2k. Yet they still lose on every sale. This ain\u2019t irrational though, it\u2019s corruption .  Caravana will drop. Because nothing makes sense. But they will. It was a pure commodity play.

Bitcoin has done historically well during fiat flash crashes, and with the AI bubble and mass war, it's probably a good idea to mimic the ultra wealthy's cash movements . It's why I am not convinced we go much higher then 120k. The whales are stashing before the involved countries values plummet .

The most realistic outcome I see is a reserved estimate of 100-150k . I think the former (running up close to or even over $500k) is more likely: we're headed into a big bull run in the stock market this year . I've seen others calling for 250 to 300 K but I'm not even sure I'm convinced about that .  If $20tril got pumped into BTC it would make the market cap potentially $100tril to $300tril . No there is a global M2 measure . M2 has banking leverage factored in if that's what you're talkign about .  It took Bitcoin around 2 and a half years to regain its ATH . The cycle will repeat itself next halving . The comments on all the crypto subs are even worse. Pure unfiltered mania and outlandish price predictions from people with 0 clue about finance and basic economics .  The muscle memory from repeated boom bust cycles in so many different assets over the past seven years is causing these things to go parabolic . In the first crypto bubble you had the whole skepticism phase play out over the course of years before it began rising amidst greater and greater skepticism .  Bitcoin is the hardest money ever created, trading it out for fiat doesn't make a ton of sense if your time horizon is far out . As long as the government manipulates the dollar via inflation, there will always be demand for an alternative, whether that be gold or bitcoin . Summarization not available for this chunk.  Bitcoin's best use case is as a store of wealth, not as a currency imo. The only rule is to hold Bitcoin for 4 years and you'll be up. Even buying at the top is most likely gonna shoot up like you said .  Bank of America has estimated the multiplier of inflows to market cap expansion being 110x. $1 inflow moves the market cap $110.1M per BTC . Bitcoin is cool and all, but have y\u2019all ever heard of Shiba Inu?  This is going to be a slow burn up now, not a volatile jump in and out . Bitcoin has no top because it will always goes up . This is a mega melt up before a melt down it\u2019ll be back to 30K maybe lower by beginning of next yr .",

Options contracts typically represent the right to buy or sell 100 shares .  The value of those contracts has increased because the options are now closer to being in the money in a short amount of time . If i sell to close on Monday at open at open i will gain just a little over 50k . The break even price is the price that his option agrees to pay combined with the fees he payed for the option .  Theta bought 8 call option contracts for a premium of $18.92/share . Each option being 100 shares means that for 1 option it cost him 1800 and he can sell it for 8700 . The option has more value because the expiration date is still pretty far out so Theta has not touched it yet .  You have the option to exercise (or sell) contracts now and profit the difference .

        "selftext": "\nHey, fellow Costco enthusiasts!\n\nI stumbled upon an interesting piece of news regarding Costco's potential plans for a membership fee increase, and I thought I'd share it with you all.\n\nAccording to a recent article in the CFO Journal, Costco's longtime CFO, Richard Galanti, who has been with the company for nearly four decades, is stepping down from his role. Gary Millerchip, the former CFO of Kroger, is set to take over next month.\n\nNow, here's where it gets intriguing. Galanti hinted in December that a membership fee increase is not a matter of if, but when. Given Costco's past practices, with the last fee hike occurring in June 2017, analysts anticipate that an increase might be announced soon.\n\nWith a new CFO stepping in, it could be a strategic move for Costco to unveil a membership fee increase during its upcoming earnings report on March 7th. This could be an opportune time for the company to make such an announcement, especially with Millerchip potentially bringing in fresh perspectives on revenue streams.\n\nHowever, some might wonder why Costco wouldn't wait later in the year to announce the increase. Well, one possible reason could be to maintain transparency and give shareholders and customers time to adjust. By announcing it early in the year, Costco can demonstrate fiscal responsibility and avoid surprises later on. Additionally, aligning the announcement with the arrival of a new CFO may signal a strategic shift in the company's financial direction, emphasizing stability and proactive decision-making.\n\nSo, fellow Costco aficionados, brace yourselves. It's very likely that we might see a bump in our membership fees in the near future. What are your thoughts on this potential change? \n\nPositions: Thursday at the close fds +%15 otm 1dte.",

        "summarized_comments": " Costco gas is usually $0.20-0.30 cheaper than any other place around me . Their meat is a higher grade than many, if not most, other grocery stores in my area .  The only actual savings in Costco are in the food court and at the pump . Costco is developing a dynamic pricing model based on MSA and concentrations of EVs within a certain mile radius of the CostCos .  People who say \"the research says\" and then refuse to provide their research because \"it's not my job to do that\" is a subpar defense of your expectation of people to just take you at your word . I read those reports prior to seeing the video, which is why I can point you to it a and not the random research I found at least 6 months ago .  Aldi and Trader Joes are just as good for wine as Trader Joins Costco . Costco is the only one not to find Costco worth it . Costco memberships cost $120 for the executive membership .  Most of the value comes from fruit, eggs and giant bags of snacks . The call price is just insane for this one and I can't bring myself to buy more at the current prices .  The Costco hot dog is one of the most iconic things ever from Costco . Costco CFO left during an acquisition that should never be allowed to happen .  Kroger is a shit show of a company. I'd abandon ship too. The cost savings on their Prosecco that my wife drinks in order to tolerate me is alone worth the membership . The customer satisfaction at Costco is unmatched and they don\u2019t have the kind of problems we regularly see at target Walmart and Fred Meyer around where I live .  Long-term COST is a solid investment, and short-term weekly calls are a bit too obvious . With all this attention, COST will continue to rise, but the break even on calls with the contract cost is not attractive as a play . Costco is like shopping in Switzerland.  Costco has been cracking down on card sharing which has increased their overall numbers. Costco has instead been cracking . Costco has not announced price hikes like Netflix announces price hikes .  The CEO change mimic $SNOW and crash the stock? Is the planned membership fee increase announcement a smoke screen to keep the price stable? All rational thinking points to Costco killing it and we see it rip, but the market makes zero sense .  The lack of mandatory self checkout is why I buy shit at Costco vs Walmart, Target, and my local piece of shit grocery store . The rental car deals on Costco travel are great deals too .",

        "title": "$HOOD event on 3/26 likely to announce the rebranding of recently aquired company X1 and offer Robinhood credit cards",
        "selftext": "Four days ago Robinhood teased that they\u2019ll be making a big PR announcement and stated \u201cThe New Gold Standard is coming\u201d (https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/1762647669368127809). They\u2019re specifically being vague here, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for them to announce their official rebrand of this acquisition for their event + Robinhood branded credit cards with point rewards directly integrated with their trading mobile applications.\n\nRobinhood bought a company called X1 for $100M back in July.\n\nhttps://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/robinhood-signs-agreement-to-acquire-x1/\n\nSo first, what is X1?\n\nX1 is a platform that offers a no-fee credit card with rewards on each purchase.\n\nFrom the PR:\n\n\"Providing people with access to a no-fee credit card aligns with our mission to democratize finance for all. The X1 stainless steel credit card has no annual fees, late fees, or foreign transaction fees. Further, design innovation is a part of Robinhood\u2019s DNA and X1 brings the sleek and intuitive mobile app experience our customers have come to expect.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition will bring us closer towards our goal of serving the entirety of our customers\u2019 critical financial needs. Together with X1, Robinhood will now be able to offer our customers access to credit,\u201d\u00a0 said Vlad Tenev, CEO and co-founder of Robinhood.\"\n\nSo, X1 seems cool, but how they even get acquired? \n\nWell, apparently...these guys were growing quick. \n\nThey had an all star list of fintech investors when they raised their seres B for $45M back in 2022. Max Levchin, founder of $AFRM, and David Sacks were investors.\n\nNow their growth was pretty remarkable -- it seems like when $HOOD bought them out, they were doing close to $30M in revenue and had built out 600k people on their waitlist before even launching.\n\nIn 2022 they projected $1B of annualized spend on their card -- this is not a huge company to be putting up those numbers, but they were, and they caught Robinhood's attention.\n\nI believe Robinhood, when they officially launch X1, are going to make a splash in the credit market because of how focused they are on product. \n\nNow, currently, X1 users are not Robinhood users -- if $HOOD can somehow get those hundreds of thousands of people to have to join Robinhood, it is going to be huge for user growth. \n\nSince X1 is owned by Robinhood, they have immediate access to send one email and begin converting those people on to their investing platform. I doubt Vlad is going to make them have to join $hood to keep using X1, but the point is, they have hundreds of thousands of users they technically now own underneath the robinhood company that might be using X1 and not even know the company is owned by hood, leading to a huge opportunity to get those users on the platform. \n\nOkay, so when they launch this card, what is going to make it so compelling for people to sign up, and how are they going to limit the riskiness of the credit card business?\n\nIt's actually really smart...X1 doesn't look at your credit score...they look at your Income.\n\nBoom. That's the difference.\n\nFrom TechCrunch article (https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/x1-card-is-a-credit-card-based-on-your-income-not-your-credit-score/amp/):\n\n\"The company says some customers can expect limits up to five times higher than what they would get from a traditional credit card. And that limit can move up if you get a promotion at your job, for instance.\n\n\u201cThe consumer credit card industry has been almost untouched by tech and has relied on the archaic credit score system. Max [Levchin], David [Sacks] and I have similar scores \u2014 that makes no sense!\u201d co-founder Deepak Rao told me. \u201cWe reimagined the credit card from the ground up to have smarter limits, intelligent features, modern rewards and a new look.\u201d\n\nAs a result -- your income determines the APR and there are no annual fees.\n\nAlso from the article:\n\n\"Depending on your creditworthiness, you\u2019ll get a variable APR of 12.9 to 19.9% and a balance transfer fee of 2%. There\u2019s no annual subscription fee and X1 Card doesn\u2019t change any late fee or foreign transaction fees.\n\nYou can then borrow as much as 25% of your total internship salary or 25% of your first three paychecks if it\u2019s a full-time job. There are some fees, but it can be helpful if you\u2019re signing a new lease and you don\u2019t have any money on your bank account, for instance.\"\n\nThis is actually really smart -- is there still some credit risk to people who won't pay back their balance? \n\nOf course, but the dynamic increasing or decreasing of credit based on something more tangible like income vs. your credit score could be a core differentiator in mitigating risk -- the service will likely also be offered to gold members, so Robinhood will increase gold revenue and people will pay $60/a year for gold which could help subsidize some of the fees Robinhood has with providing the card even though the card itself does not charge an annual fee.\n\nIf people signup just for the card, they will be introduced to $HOOD, and start depositing money into the app, exploding deposits.\n\nX1 has 12K ratings in the app store with 4.9/5 stars. People love this product. It makes sense why Robinhood bought them out -- they are so product focused, they only wanted to integrate a credit card if the product itself and it's benefits were 10x beyond how consumers engaged with typical credit cards.\n\nSo far, $HOOD has done $9M in revenue off this card, $4M in Q3 2023 and $5M in Q4 2023. \n\nIf Robinhood has a successful launch of this card, there will be hundreds of thousands of current Robinhood users who sign up along with potentially hundreds of thousands of current X1 users who don't even know about Robinhood to sign up. \n\nThe physical gold metal card can be iconic, the rewards and cashback can be strong for people who haven't had a great experience with credit cards, and the digital native portions of the card (canceling subscriptions right from the X1 app itself) can be very appealing to users. \n\nRobinhood can tell all 10.9M monthly active users that a new credit card is available when it launches and potentially grow revenue from this card substantially.\n\nThe biggest part of what they might try to do...\n\nYour points from using the Robinhood card could automatically result in getting cashback that immediately is invested into the stocks you want to invest in using....Robinhood. \n\nAgain this is all speculation - the event could be simply something like a new revitalized Gold subscription program or something and flops (aka they could PayPal it), but I think this is going to allude to a much longer term bet.\n\nMy position: 13c 8/16 x20",

At 31, I had $0 in my retirement savings. At 41, I have $106k. at 41. I look at my Roth and shake my head as I should have so much more than I do .  The survey is skewed toward the rich, and is not a picture of average . The people who answerd are the ones who are actively saving for retirement, it becomes a dick measurement contest .  An investor says he's on a revenge tour to make back the cash he lost to his ex-wife . The benefits of marriage are not there anymore. They really aren't\u2026 better off staying single in today\u2019s world unless you wanna pay up .  An angry Reddit user downvoted a Reddit post about saving for retirement . The post has been edited by the user . The user is a 34-year-old single man who has no retirement savings .  These threads always turn into pissing contests but I'm proud of where I'm at so I'll post. I have no problem sharing where I\u2019m at just wasn\u2019t sure if it was necessary or helpful .  When we took the keys to our new home, it had over $150,000 in equity, and we have a 2.5% mortgage rate . If we get to count that towards \u201cretirement\u201d then I feel like we\u2019ve done well . But if not, I feel that we\u201dre behind because we focused there first .  When I turned 32 I had 131k and when I turned 33, largely through a down year, I had 172k . I've been maxing my 401k, my Roth, my HSA and putting some into a brokerage at 300 per week .  Currently around 95k in 401k, 38k in Roth IRA, 110k in brokerage, and holding about 40k in cash earning 5.x% . I feel like I've done jack shit to actually set myself and family up for a healthy retirement . I'm meeting with schwab soon to get a consultation .  A good goal for retirement is 30x what you want to spend per year in retirement (less your expected CPP/OAS/Other Pension etc) If I retired now I would want to retire about 60k/year, less 20k from pensions etc. 40k x 30 and 1.2 million is the number I feel I need .  At age 32 I probably had $20,000 saved for retirement . Save as much as reasonable early to gain the compounding bonus . Save $450k in 401k, $80k in stocks, $130k in brokerage, $7k in ROTH IRA .  A man in the 30-34 age range has about $100K in retirement savings and about $90K in liquid cash for a home purchase in the near future . A woman in her mid-30s has about 315k in retirement accounts . Another man in his mid-40s is in the top 5% of retirement savings by age .  The amount of money you'll need depends highly on how you want to live and how much debt you have . If you had 10 million in retirement, that stuff doesn't matter as much .  Good employment and real estate were significant drivers27 with 88k over 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA30 with ~$118k in 401k . I expect to retire at 55 if I hunker down and conditions are decent, otherwise somewhere between 55-60 .",

Currently have $350k in my checking/savings.  I have another  $105k between all my retirement accounts.  I have $36k in a traditional IRA (Vanguard), I have $9k in a Roth IRA (Vanguard).  I have $68k in a Roth account through my job (John Hancock).  I\u2019m contributing 6%.  I recently opened a brokerage account to buy CD\u2019s / T-Bills to dip my toes in the investing waters.  I\u2019ve been also reading up on ETF\u2019s, stock, mutual funds etc to educate myself for future investing.\n\nGiven I have a lump sum to invest with (I\u2019d be open to put up to ~$200k out there), I was curious if it still makes the most sense to diversify across multiple investments (currently thinking some popular Vanguard ETF\u2019s + T-Bill / CD)?  \n\nI\u2019m not looking to become a millionaire here, but need to start investing to make my money work for me.\n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.\n",

        "summarized_comments": " If you can't mentally handle lump summing $300k+ then DCA over the shortest period you can handle . Lump sum beats DCA about 2/3rds the time if the marketing going down leads you to sleepless nights or worse freaking out and selling at the bottom of a crash .  The mix of politics, war, and other factors leaves me unsure about this year's economic outlook . I've thought of a solution: allocating 25% of my cash (let's say $100k) from a High Yield Savings Account (HYSA) to index funds .  There's nothing particularly irresponsible about throwing long-term savings money at the S&amp;P 500 . Long term gains tend to be 10% per year . Not losing money is important in the stock market business, unless he has a reasonable stop loss order .  If your wife has income, ideally she'd aim for the same, another $7k to IRA, $23k to 401k . If the savings rate is too steep to maintain, take from that pile of not-retirement money to cover the shortfall . Lump sum vs. DCA is mostly risk mitigation to make you feel better about it .  OP: $350K is way too much to for a man your age to have sitting in a bank account . With multiple decades to retirement, compound interest can absolutely turn $200K into over $1 million . The market has been very volatile for most of the last decade .  A portfolio of total-market index-based low-cost stock &amp; bond funds makes sense at any age . Put as much as possible in tax-advantaged accounts as soon as possible . Investing ASAP won't work every time, no one knows when it will work . Summarization not available for this chunk.  You should make a diversified asset allocation plan for your own assets . This will prevent you from having to improvise when you encounter some situations . Diversification in investing refers to not putting all your eggs in one basket .",

Invest in a good sonic toothbrush, a dental floss, and a mouthwash 3 times a day, rinse and repeat . Find several adults that have achieved things that you want to achieve yourself .  There are two types of IRAs, traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs . If you expect your taxes in retirement to be lower, a traditional IRA is better than a Roth .  VOO is a specific investment fund, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Index of the top 500 publicly owned companies in America . This is a good way to get broad exposure to the overall market without paying many fees . Fidelity has a lot of education tools for people getting started .  A Traditional IRA is just like a Roth but the exact opposite- you don't pay taxes now, you pay them when you withdraw . The money you put into these accounts is what you end up investing when you buy stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds . DO NOT get involved with crypto or individual stocks .  If the US economy falters, VOO goes down . If the biggest US companies were not doing well, neither would the small and mid sized ones . There are similar etf\u2019s for international markets, so you can\u2019t go wrong there .  Google has been able to complete do Gemini without needing anything from Nvidia . Nobody has anywhere near the reach Google enjoys . Android now has over 3.5 billion active devices. They now have 17 different service with over half a billion DAU.  You can get yourself into a mess if you try and chase gains or are always messing with your portfolio . Ignore investing in bonds for a few decades, if ever . Ignore trading fees based on how you do it . Invest in Gold. You wont lose!!  Bitcoin is the best performing asset class in the world, says /r/ethfinance user . Get some \"term\" life insurance when you can . Start with a budget and organise your life in detail to organise your finances .  You need to be AS DETAILED AS POSSIBLE while having some flexibility (like an excess fund and emergency fund... not all months are the same cost wise) Do not go into speculative investments like crypto, options, futures or high risk investing like leveraged investing . Avoid trading as well. This isn't suitable for anyone who isn't doing it as moreorless a full time job .  These have the advantage of employers who are also required to match your contributions to a certain amount . This essentially means you're gaining additional money that isn't yours from your employer . Unlike the stock market which are abstract assets based on real entities, real estate is skipping the abstract idea of stocks and buying the entity directly .  The answer is that if you\u2019re young you should be 100% invested in equities, particularly growth stocks that pay little or no dividend but otherwise have strong financials . Bonds also have long term vs short term bonds and also also have maturing spans .",

Heavily Shorted ( for no reason)  Dividend aristocrats have vastly less risk than some of the large-cap tech companies in the S&amp;P that are prone to massive swings in the market . Dividends are for when you want stability and can't handle too much volatility .  A consistently profitable company that slowly grows over time and hasn\u2019t cut its dividend in, say, ten years is a great investment . You own the money if its inside the company or your pocket . Super high dividend stocks tend not to have great total returns .  \"Dividends are not \"free money,\" but they are very much part of total return,\" says OP . Dividends that are reinvested acquire more shares, which naturally increases the value of your asset with even slight capital appreciation .  From 1930\u20132022, dividend income's contribution to the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index averaged 41% . But one should not confuse dividends with returns that doesn't really make sense .  Dividends are factored into the total return of SCHD, O, and UHT, which is why I am largely in growth . Pure dividend is not a successful play in terms of total returns, and I still wouldn't recommend a pure dividend play to anyone .  Most companies with high dividends are not growth companies, they are somewhat stagnant, so you are losing the growth in the price of the stock in favor of the dividend payout . Total returns are what matters, and total return is all that matters .",

        "selftext": "I have been hearing a lot of buzz around a couple of stocks, namely SMCI and NVDA.  I want to discuss what I believe is going to happen in the next two weeks if SMCI lands into the S&amp;P 500 as it is on track to do.\n\nI will mainly discuss SMCI in this post.  As it stands, SMCI is trading at $905.48 and has a market cap of $50.65 billion USD.\n\nCurrently, SMCI is trading in the Russell 2000 (RUT).  It is the highest cap stock in the RUT by about 300%.  This disparity is why I believe that joining the S&amp;P 500 is a death sentence to the stock price, and the downwards pressure and volatility will happen extremely quickly once it is added.  I will explain why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe majority of investors nowadays invest their money passively through retirement accounts/401k's or just are told that their money is safer if you put it into ETFs.  This results in a MASSIVE amount of inflow into a basket of stocks without much/any DD discerning the individual stocks in the basket.  As for market cap weighted indices/ETFs, the percentage of that index is based on the market cap of the stock.\n\nIf I put $1,000 into the RUT, as it currently stands, $1.62 of that will be towards SMCI, while the next highest stock, MSTR, will receive $0.51.  As SMCI increases in market cap, even more of the inflow into the RUT will get pumped passively into SMCI.  This is a self-perpetuating cycle of inflow into the highest capped stock(s) in the index. \n\nNow onto the S&amp;P 500.  I am going to compare SMCI to 3M, which has a market cap of $50.77 billion and is currently sitting in the S&amp;P 500.  3M is weighted to 0.12% of the entire S&amp;P, meaning it receives approximately 0.12% of the inflow.  If SMCI enters into the S&amp;P, I expect it to receive about the same, 0.12% inflow.  Now looking at the daily volume of SPY (S&amp;P ETF) vs IWM (RUT ETF), there is about 5.5x the flow of SPY vs. IWM, meaning SPY gets 5.5x more money going through it daily.\n\nDoing some quick math off this, SMCI is currently sitting at an inflow of 1.62%(IWM) and will turn into 0.12%(SPY).  Turning the units of SPY into IWM, we multiply the 0.12 by 5.5, so 0.12%(SPY)\\*5.5(SPY)/(IWM) nets us 0.65%(IWM).\n\nThe ratio of inflow into SMCI immediately after it enters the S&amp;P will be 0.65/1.62\\*100 = 40% of what it is currently getting while outperforming in the RUT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis tells me that the inflow into SMCI is going to take a 60% decline overnight as soon as it gets put into the S&amp;P.  Obviously there are other factors and the RUT is not the only ETF or fund trading SMCI right now, but the underlying argument still stands that the inflow is going to be GREATLY reduced instantaneously, likely causing a massive shock to the stock price.\n\nThis same calculation can be used on other over or underperforming stocks in their indices if they are set to jump from one index to another.",

        "selftext": "I had a friend who worked at GE and he called it a bloated monstrosity of incompetence. He was a high level technologist there. \n\nBut that was going on a decade ago. At the time they were massively in debt and were making money in a confusing assortment of ways. \n\nQuotes from Barron\u2019s:\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-ge-stock-price-pick-ceo-larry-culp-8ce1498c?mod=panda_barrons_custom_topic_alert\n\nGE have sold off a LOT of assets to reduce their massive debt.\n\n&gt; GE has repaid some $100 billion in debt since the end of 2018, bringing its debt load down to just $21 billion. What\u2019s more, free cash flow, which had dropped from $5.6 billion in 2017 to $2.3 billion in 2019, has started growing again: GE generated $5.2 billion in 2023 and should produce more than $6 billion in 2024.\n\nGE is in the process of splitting itself into multiple companies instead of being a mishmash of unrelated products from light bulbs to jet engines. The conglomerate, first started by Edison, is a going to be a very different thing. \n\n&gt; the early 2023 spinoff of GE HealthCare Technologies, which makes medical imaging products, shares of General Electric have gained about 120%, while GE HealthCare has gained 50%. Both have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index, which has advanced 30% over the same span.\n\n&gt; The final move is due on April 2, with **General Electric splitting itself into two.** The parent company will be renamed GE Aerospace, and will be a maker of airplane engines; and the power business will be spun off and named GE Vernova. **Shareholders will receive one GE Vernova share for every four GE shares.**\n\n&gt; Buying General Electric stock ahead of that split could well pay off handsomely. There\u2019s a strong case that the two new stocks together will be worth more than the existing shares.\n\n&gt; The truth is, all three of the new companies will be dominant players in their respective industries and, remarkably, all three will have investment-grade credit ratings.\n\n&gt; GE Aerospace, though, is the crown jewel. Three-quarters of new single-aisle jets made by Boeing and Airbus carry GE engines, and they\u2019re also found on twin-aisle jetliners like the 787 Dreamliner and jet fighters like the F-18 Hornet. In total, there are more than 40,000 GE engines in commercial airliners and 26,000 in military aircraft.\n\nThis is what I\u2019ve honestly been drooling about. The ability to get GE\u2019s aerospace business without being hampered by its credit business, and its thousand other businesses. That\u2019s what this split entails. You want their healthcare, you can invest directly in that. \n\nConglomerates are early 1900s organizations that benefitted from anti-trust practices. They could lower the costs of a sector to starve out competitors knowing they have income from completely other revenue sources.\n\nBut those days are gone, and investors want more focus in their companies. It\u2019s why some of the big tech companies lately have laid off workers and shut down projects. Like apple\u2019s car, and googles many side endeavors. \n\nSorry, big quote ahead but a lot of good data.\n\n&gt; Both Boeing and Airbus expect the global airline fleet to grow to some 50,000 planes over the coming 20 years, up from about 25,000 today. GE\u2019s aerospace sales and orders both grew about 22% in 2023 compared with 2022. What\u2019s more, every engine GE sells needs to be serviced and cared for. That aftermarket business accounted for 70% of Aerospace\u2019s $32 billion in sales in 2023, and is more profitable than selling new equipment. Wall Street expects operating profit margins to expand by about two percentage points over the coming few years, up from about 19% in 2023, as new engines start to hit the shop for scheduled maintenance. That business should help Ebitda. hit about $8 billion in 2024, up from $7.2 billion in 2023; it could reach $9 billion in 2025\n\nGE is still going to split between aerospace and the power generation business, Vernova. I\u2019m more interested in aero, but I feel it will run up until split and I\u2019ll basically buy 2 companies now at a discount and I can always divest power.\n\nThis isn\u2019t typically the kind of company I go for, but I think it has great potential and it\u2019s a famous US name that has hit the skids for\u2026a while now. And I think they got a compelling way forward, even if they lost the lightbulb monopoly.\n\n",

        "summarized_comments": " With ETFs they can use a tax loophole to wash away any capital gains that would be caused by rebalacing, or companies moving in and out of the index . Mutual funds cannot avoid this, but it depends on fund in flows and out flows . If the fund has enough inflows it may not need to do much selling, to rebalance it just buys the stocks it is underwheight in .",

        "title": "Investing at 19: Roth IRA vs. Individual Taxable Brokerage Account",
        "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI've been considering whether I should start investing in a Roth IRA now or stick with my regular brokerage account. I'm 19 and trying to make smart financial decisions for my future.  \nWith my current job, I can contribute about $100 per month to a Roth IRA, which fits within my budget. I understand I can only contribute up to the amount I make in a year if I cant max it out. Some people say I might miss the accessibility of funds in a regular brokerage account, but after looking into it, I'm not too worried.  \nIn a regular account, I can sell stocks and use the money, but I'll have to pay taxes on any profits. However, with a Roth IRA, I can't touch the profits until I'm nearly 60 without penalties, but I can withdraw the money I put in without any penalties or taxes. So, the accessibility concern isn't a big issue for me since I'm planning on keeping it for retirement.  \nI've done the math, and even with just $100 a month and a 7% return, starting a Roth IRA now could mean an extra $50,000 in my account by the time I retire compared to waiting 3 years until I land my first full-time job after college where I plan on opening one anyway.  \nSo, what's the downside of starting a Roth IRA now? I don't really see one. It seems like a smart move to take advantage of compound interest and set myself up for a better retirement later on.  \nWhat do you all think? If my logic is wrong anywhere please let me know. Right now it seems like it would be dumn to continue to invest in a taxable account before a Roth. ",
