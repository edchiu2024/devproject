        "summarized_comments": " Retail stores have slashed their labor so much that its painful to shop nowadays . The strategy is continuing to be employed by good startups . The off-shoring will continue .  How much do you need to take it easy at 50? Take your annual expense x 25 x 25 (ie 4% rule) That's your financial independent number . Then you can take easy until you feel like you want to retire .  The best developer I ever worked with is from the Cameroon, unlike India where English is an afterthought, a lot of West Africans speak both English and their mother tongue fluently . An under rated talent pool is West Africa .  The company is switching from hiring in poland to hiring in india, because poland is getting too expensive . The company itself should be able to handle external contributors too, and the contributors should be also reliable . It's a way for multiple CTOs to move up the ladder.  Unions lead to higher unemployment as they force higher wages and thus less hiring . Unions also tend to lobby, leading to regulatory capture and stymieing innovation . Reddit is all pro science until they disagree with science .  As a result of that, customers lose confidence and shift their business . If the company\u2019s business is very sticky, then it might take a long time to shift to a competitor . Companies like GM have no idea how to use their software teams in the first place .  Car manufacturers are in no position to beat Google by $100,000 a year . They have to pay more for talent to get it back on the road .  Once you use CarPlay you can\u2019t go back. Maps are way better in CarPlay than a dedicated Garmin or TomTom GPS unit. The best thing is no extra monthly subscription fee .  Toyota announced way back in December 2023 that it would be stopping support for Apple Carplay and Android Auto . The writing was on the wall from the early 2000\u2019s and GM failed to take the necessary action . The Japanese and Koreans are firmly in control of the economy auto sector for middle class consumers .  No Apple CarPlay is a deal breaker for me, I don\u2019t want to manage yet another software ecosystem, I just want the maps and music app of my everyday device to work in car mode . The mobile apps on the other hand are weak, which is terrible in this day .  In general, I like a lot of GM\u2019s designs until I own them . I love cars, period, so to me this was a fun adventure on a good deal, to try something out, and break even . Not one has been a lemon .  America needs to pass laws to stop throwing people into poverty like this . Working people deserve protection from mass layoffs like this, GODDAMN IT, the company should be fined and forced to pay these people for at least 6 months . I suspect many are retiring early and that is why it is not showing up in the job numbers .  The auto industry is also pretty ass when it comes to layoffs . The automotive companies have been doing this forever. Its not related to the economy or the world even, they just layoff every now and then .  American workers should be pushing for Hybrid models at a minimum . If you\u2019re working effectively 100% remote then you can be replaced by anyone anywhere in the world . Time for OVERLY WOKE MARY BARRA to LEAVE!",

I built this \u201cportfolio\u201d 4 years ago and am up 30% or so, the reason for the \u201cperceived\u201d underperformance is that I\u2019ve increased my monthly contributions since last year which has led to a large rise in average cost basis. I\u2019m hoping to cross the 100k mark in the next 12 months if the current trajectory continues.\u00a0\n\nWhile I recognize that investing is a long-term game, the process feels slow at times. I'm curious to hear from others who have pursued a similar passive investing strategy.\n\nHow long did it take for your portfolio to reach a point where the annual passive income matched or exceeded your annual salary? When did you feel comfortable enough with your portfolio's performance and size to consider retiring or achieving financial independence. Specifically, how long did it take before you felt your portfolio could sustain your lifestyle without the need for additional income from employment?",

        "summarized_comments": " The best thing you can have in your life is freedom, not just money, but it's a good thing for you to have a good job at home .  Heavily invested in rental and stocks, which do you prefer now based on returns and lifestyle impact? \"I\u2019ve done a few self managed rentals and am strongly in favor of equities\"  When I was 19, my vocational school teacher told me to put $300 from every check into a Roth and I'd retire with $3m by the time I was 35 . He was right to some degree, especially considering the markets since then, and I think I regret not listening to him more than anything else in life .  Many people who went frugal to just be a \"millionaire\" by 33 or whatever are miserable now . You can get there a lot faster either by hammering it hard early or making a lot more money later . Be responsible and save for the future but remember money is a tool not a number you wanna chase .  You can either front load this process, take advantage of time in the market and 'sacrifice' a bit of 'fun' in your 20s . Or you can start later, save more aggressively and hope that your salary can support this aggressive approach .  An hourly worker in a paper mill has grown his net worth to $1.7 million . The only reason I can't retire now is because I have advanced kidney disease and need the health insurance .  The company could be worth over $100B in less than 2 years if executed as planned . Valuations based on fundamentals put it closer to $20 in 12 months time . Once it hits that, it'll likely go up a lot from there .  Historically, the US economy grows more when a Democrat is in office, but because of propaganda, the myth that \"Republicans are better for the economy\" remains . Since 1933, the economy has grown at an annual average rate of 4.6 percent under Democratic presidents and 2.4 percent under Republicans .  One can live a decent life on $120k per year in a LCOL area . That means \\~$7k/month (post taxes) A principal of $2.4M in stocks is rich .  It's hard to get rich without investing because inflation will eat your savings faster than you make money from your job . The thing about investing is you will almost always get a better return than leaving the same money in the bank .  You won't get rich by investing in the entire S&amp;P 500. You will secure your retirement and likely a very good one at that, but you won't magically get rich . Total market ETFs and blue chips will generally give you growth over inflation, but as you said it will be a slow and boring grind . It's ok to have a small percentage of your portfolio dedicated to more exciting stuff .  The way to get rich is slowly - there is no get rich quick scheme and only high risk investments will be able to speed things up . If you didn't know that means that you could end up poorer than you started because that is what high risk means .  It took me 8 years from start to rich, but it's wild that I'm almost back to where my account was in only 2 years due to DCAing frequently and making some good stock choices .  You become rich by spending less than you make and investing is how you amass wealth . By year 10 you realize investing is just part of your habits and you don't think of the time it will take to get rich and retire because you've already created a fulfilling life as you are .  The investments portion of net worth (not including home) has gone up 500% since I started tracking it 7 years ago . If you include the house, it's a 450% increase, but selling our house doesn't factor into retirement plans so I don't typically include it .  You're likely never going to be \"rich\" by passively investing unlevered, by definition you're getting the same market return as a very large cohort of other people in your boat . Prices for the things you will want being 'rich' will also go up, just look at what happened to asset inflation and things like private school tuitions since the pandemic .  A dad who was busy on stock market is the easiest way to be rich, not under 60 years as daddy did . Today's youth want to be . rich quickly, not . under 60 . years as dad did .  Chasing growth means treating your investment like a time capsule, you do not touch that money for a good long while, you define your time frame and plan a strategy accordingly . Without an income there is generally a limit to the returns you can make over a couple decades .  In his opinion, becoming rich is not a coincidence. It is a goal that you achieve by following principles and making wise decisions. Investing will not make you rich. You can get rich by trading, but you can also go poor doing it .  Buy and hold can be slow, but I bought MSFT at about $27.50, so the value has increased tremendously . It took nearly 30 years to get to that first $1 million, only to have $2 million five years later . My passive income didn't match my final salary until about 9 years after I retired .",

The fine would be the equivalent of a $2-5k fine on the millions . Icahn has been artificially inflating the price of his company .  Icahn is betting on whether the conceit lasts long enough for shareholders to make a return via the cash dividends before the house of cards collapsed . Ultimately it\u2019s a house built on stilts and the side is coming in, it can\u2019t hang on forever .  The fine is simply the cost of doing business, the 'fine' is the cost to do business .

        "summarized_comments": " The market is predicting a kamala win, but not a congressional sweep, so gridlock... aka predictability; nothing will change . Raising corporate taxes is like hiking their electric bill . The increased expenses will just be passed on to the consumer . Interest rates will remain higher during a Harris administration .  Jpow was given a virtually impossible situation IMO- a global pandemic that shutdown the world and killed non-remote jobs- a president that downplayed the pandemic- an economy that was gifted 10 years of rock bottom interest rates- a corporate tax rate being slashed 14% the year he became the Fed chair . He could\u2019ve raised rates a little sooner, instead of saying inflation was \u201ctransitory\u201d. He should be commended for reversing course .  The stock market has inflated a lot since the Trump presidency to reflect the lower tax rate, but the stock market is not the economy . Kamala should just do what Biden did last election, let Trump shit talk his way to defeat as he did in 2020 .  Inflating the debt away is the more likely third option, says John McCain . McCain: We have a 0% chance of cutting spending because we are degenerates. We will shoulder most of this burden to try our best to protect future generations .  The wealthy will NEVER pay as high of a tax rate as lower income individuals because of the way the entire system is structured . Most of the policies being proposed like higher taxes, price controls, rent control, etc. have been tried in countries like Argentina, Cuba, Venezuela, and none of the benefits the government claimed would come from it did .  The tax rate is currently 21%, most corporations are pay much less or nothing due to their massive tax incentives . The one outlier there, NVIDIA, has run out of tax credits after using the tax breaks to take on losses and grow (which is how it\u2019s supposed to work)  It will have some impact on spending, but it\u2019s probably not easily identifiable without a really complex analysis due to the number of moving parts . The impact of taxes is different for every good or service based on different elasticities .  There is no such thing as a business tax, it is really a consumer tax . With the monopolies and oligopolies in most US industries, any tax increases are just passed on as price increases . The companies are free to raise prices to compensate .  The market will always want a Democrat president and deadlocked Congress . Trump's tariffs would be a disaster if implemented. They won't go through. The rich have the resources to hire the best people to help them reduce their tax bill .  The corporate tax rate conversation is sensational because politicians (both sides) want the public to be looking at the real issues . The inflation caused by our rapidly growing debt and the higher rates to issue US debt notes is a much larger concern - an existential one .  Trump\u2019s tariffs, incompetency, and attempts to overthrow our government result in lower stock prices . Americans have an incorrect belief that Republicans are \u201cgood\u201d for the economy and Democrats are \u2018bad\u2019 for economy .  The recent spike in the U.S. stock market (2023/24) has mainly to do with promise of AI which has nothing to do . The deductions are what matters more not the rate . The richest will benefit less and there will be new winners as a result of greater cash flow .  The tax hike is meaningless and the scare tactic around it is such bullshit. It doesn't affect investment cases for moat investors as those tax event are ever changing, and there exist ways to work around them somewhat . Companies will have a few years to plan for it. Most valuations are based on EBITDA, anyway .  There are many factors which may/may not affect stock prices . Raising corporate taxes will inevitably mean more capital investment to avoid paying taxes on the profits, and it long overdue .",

But do you know exactly what the new CEO will be getting?\n\nSB released their 8-K filing, which outlines the CEO's offer letter.\n\nto quickly break it down, and its a crazy .... (this isnt all of it... i just stopped reading after a bit)\n\n**Salary**\n\n* base salary is $1.6mm/yr\n* reviewed annually. may be increased in discrection of the board\n* base salary may not be decreased without CEO's express written consent.\n\n**Annual incentive**\n\n* annual cash bonus with target of **225% of base salary and max of 450% of base salary**. Meaning he gets a bonus of anywhere $3.6mm to $7.2mm... if he does SHIT performance for 1 year, he is still guaranteed $3.6mm...\n\n\n**Long Term Incentive Plan**\n\n* Starting 2025, Grant of $23mm. vesting 25% / year. (im not 100% sure, but i believe he gets a new grant every year.)\n\n**Signing bonus**\n\n* $10mm signing bonus. a sign on bonus thats 6.25x his base salary\n\n**Replacement Grant**\n\n* Receive a grant of Company equity for leaving Chipotle\n* (has a calculation to determine how much CEO will receive in the event of leaving SB. regardless, its a SHITLOAD) in the $75mm to $80mm range.\n\n**Termination**\n\n* Has severance plan.\n* if he gets terminated, he gets an insane severance plan. Literally enough that even if he didnt have any compensation/salary/Stocks, his severance plan will be enough for him to retire on\n\n**Executive life insurance**\n\n* family coverage\n* equal to 3x annualized based salary. Fully covered by SB\n* pay purchase additional 2x annualized base salary up to max additional LI of $2mm.\n\n(SB states \"As an executive, you and your family have a greater exposure to financial loss resulting from your death. Starbucks recognizes this exposure and has\nprovided for coverage greater\". So i guess his 1 year TC of $10mm+, along with his $10mm signing bonus is not enough for his family in the untimely possibility of his death. SB gives him even MORE additional coverage (which SB pays for) for LI.)\n\n\n**Executive Physical Exam**\n\n(gets special treatment for physical exams. Looks like everyone on the executive team does)\n\n**Work location**\n\n(SB PAYS him to be 100% remote work. gives him his own assistance and full personal office. which SB will also provide and pay for, for maintenance)\n\n* Not required to relocated to HQ (Seattle, WA)\n* from start date until procurment of secondary residence in Seattle (up to 3 months)\nSB will cover temp housing and provide a driver while in seattle\n* If decided to relocated to Seattle, WA, eligible for reimbursement for relocation expenses\n\n**Work conditions**\n\n* starting from the Start Date. company will provide a full remote office for work in Cali.\n* provide assistance of CEO's choosing.\n* Office will be maintained at expense of SB\n\n\nLastly, as CEO, he will be reporting directly to the Board. but get this. he will be appointed to the board of directors as Chairman. (which is usually standard, but still crazy... you report to... yourself)",

        "summarized_comments": " He 7xed Chipotles profits and doubled sales . He played his cards not in small portion unlike chipotle bowl . But a more sober assessment would include the fact he's been presiding over the last 2-3 years in which there\u2019s been a lot of stagnation and declining reputation .  Brian Niccol jumped ship at the right time and got SB to pay him a guaranteed vesting schedule he had at Chipotle and get more guaranteed no matter what happens at SB . This notion of celebrity ceos is absolutely ridiculous and the money they are all collective stealing from real owners of the business because the boards are corrupted is ridiculous .  The new Starbucks CEO is a successful CEO of a similarly large company . He's most known for cutting corners at Chipotle . The company makes money to pay him if they do well, ie share holders do well .  Taco Bell and Chipotle had flagging sales and reputational damage prior to Niccol's arrival . The mobile app situation is ripe to be sorted out. Menu simplification rarely works, adding complexity to the logistics and ops, with minimal gain .  The new CEO has lots of different paths he could go down which will improve the company, says one user . Starbucks has tons of potential and room to grow, he says . The bigger issues, such as menu complexity, idle customer time and mobile app chaos are things that will move the needle .  A CEO who has no clue and no experience with the actual retail coal face of such a business would typically be a mistake . He pushed it hard last year to dismal results. Then he heard he was going to double down on it again this year on the premise it just needs more time and promotion... except now the commodity itself has ballooned in cost .  The primary role of a leader is to ensure the company is moving in the right direction\u2014otherwise, what's the point of having a CEO? My argument is that in the majority of cases, it's the director-level management that's truly driving the company and facilitating its growth .  The new Starbucks CEO will be squeezed for every last dollar with classic techniques like upselling, shrinkflation, and a reduction in quality while employees will simultaneously be pushed to the breaking point . The CEO's impact is limited because of his ability to \"create shareholder value,\" says John Defterios .  People love Starbucks especially the Roastery . But the buzz right now isn\u2019t at Starbucks even though China is in the grips of a coffee fever . The coffee has long been perceived as burnt and crummy .  The weirdest part to me is not relocating to Seattle, but for a CEO to not have a base of operations in the HQ is weird . The CEO gets a bonus of anywhere $3.6mm to $7.2mm... if he does SHIT performance for 1 year, he is still guaranteed $3mm...  The CEO's pay package is consistent with the huge ship he will be commanding and the dramatic turn around he needs . If he does even half as good a job as he did at chipotle I expect sbux stock to be doing quite well in a few years .  In case of chipotle I see a company that has been doing quite well in the sector . I expect many of the employees aren't happy with their jobs though because most of them want less drama, better pay and that isnt likely to happen working for fast food . The company probably will still struggle with some issues for awhile, but I expect the outcome is going to be better for everyone involved .  CEO is paid to create value, and if he/she succeeds, these compensations are peanuts . Starbucks is looking mighty stale in comparison so we will see .  The market confuses the shit out of me. I lucked out, I was building a position in SBUX at 75. It shot up to 93 on this news. Then they mention giving him an 85 million dollar bonus. I figured the share price should drop on that? Nope. It went up 2 more dollars. Let him live. He deserves all the money in the world. Let's live. I make better coffee than Starbucks 7-8$ coffee so i aint buying it .  If he does SHIT performance for 1 year, he is still guaranteed $3.6mm a year . That's if it's 100% funded. That's not usually what a target bonus means. Not because of some inherently genius marketing or advertising .",

        "summarized_comments": " Cramer gets a bad wrap, what he does is extremely hard giving people buy and sell advice on basically any ticker under the sun . Nobody else who\u2019s experienced/knowledgable enough and entertaining enough is probably willing to go on live TV day in and day out and make calls like that knowing damn well they\u2019ll have egg on their face half the time .  He and Faber are a great combo and do a good job talking the impact of things like mergers, fed decisions and whatever else in a (relatively) entertaining way . I've never looked to him for advice on what to buy or not buy but he does have a ton of knowledge and experience to learn from .  Some people would rather have less volatility even if that comes at the expense of performance . If you just want performance and nothing else, just buy the Mag 7 or 10 companies . Anyone who goes active is trying to beat the system, and almost always fails .  The longer X is, the smaller the % of fund managers let alone people in general that are able to beat the index . The active management industry feeds on people trying to \"beat the system\"  Hedge funds underperform the market, but that's not the point of hedge funds . The point is to mitigate losses for wealthy individuals and reduce sequencing risk when these clients spend their money . The longer you have your money in these hedge funds, the worse you do .  The comment was not talking about financial planners or advisors, it was talking about fund managers . The latter have more to worry about than pure total return . There are certainly use cases for financial advisors, as long as they don't pretend to be able to pick stocks .  The S&amp;P 500 is an inappropriate bench mark for edit: most fund managers . 98% of fund managers underperform the SP500 over a 30 year time frame . The fact that close to 100% of hedge funds lose to indexes is laughable .  Most don't know what it's like to have a million or a few million saved for retirement and how hard it is to make and save that . When the market goes tits up and goes to recession, money can disappear real fast if you\u2019re not diversified into safe things like bonds .  The low interest-rate, QE era instigated by FED has truly warped so much of our economy and financial markets . The VOO will easily get beat when the market goes down, is volatile or sideways . The trust has trading restrictions to reduce conflicts of interest and prevent \"front running\"  Jim Cramer is an effective short term stock picker . He doesn't outperform the market in the long run, although 1.47% is pretty darn close . Most people who have enough money for it to be in an actively managed fund don\u2019t care about gains so much as wealth preservation .  Cramer's book is how I learned about VOO back in the day . Most managers fail to beat the market though. This is common knowledge of hedge funds can't beat an index fund .  1.5% over 5 years, he's practically 1:1 with an index fund . He's an entertainer, not someone you should currently be following for advice .  No one can beat VOO over long periods. It's fools errand. It\u2019s a fool's errand, no one can do it over 70 years. I feel like giving Jim Cramer your money is the prime example of survival of the fittest. I go against everything he says and I thought I was doing just fine LOL. Folks who inverse invest against Cramer swimming in cash .",

The temptation must be enormous. Think about it: Analysts' targets are public, you already know whether you'll beat expectations or not, and it wouldn't be difficult to find someone on the other side of the world to execute trades on your behalf. Payments could be made in crypto, gold, freaking wine bottles or whatever. The opportunity to exploit earnings information seems so staggeringly easy and potentially lucrative that it's almost impossible to believe\u2014given human nature\u2014that this isn't happening far more frequently than we know.",

He isn\u2019t picking stocks hoping they win, he gets to pick the winners . Buffett's ability to evolve and adapt is even more impressive than his original skillset .  Paul Pelosi essentially has immunity since he\u2019s married to Nancy. He knows he can do whatever the fuck he wants and get away with it. He trades mega cap options and people here just parrot nonsense. It's not illegal anymore for them to trade .  Market is extremely irrational. Internally you think we had a shit Quarter and stock goes up, or you have a cracking Quarter and beat the expectations, but stock goes down because we didn't beat the 'expectations of beating expectations' at an 'expected level'  The FTC is aware of the fact that employees of a company may have insider knowledge . Don't even need to be senior to have a bunch of access to information that you can extrapolate . But is a small fish really going to ever get caught?  It's extremely common, everyone is trying to do it all the time. Incredibly easy to sneak a peek and trade off of the info. The catch is people only actually care when lots of people get hurt, or there is an extreme conflict of interest .  Pre-market trading suggests early morning leading up to 9:30am, or did it start to really move before the NYT article was posted..? Some brokers you can buy pre-market I know and some stocks you can as well .  The STOCK act makes it illegal for congress to trade on insider info -- so if a congressman made a trade and it was later realized that it was based on insider information, that will be a big deal . Members of Congress trading is not illegal so there\u2019s nothing for them to investigate .  The country is run by mostly criminals according to some redditors . Members of congress have gone to jail and faced fines and investigations if they are suspected of insider trading .  The amount of trades that use insider info compared to the total trades is probably so small it has no real impact on the market . The rules more or less keep it from being a debilitating market problem .  It is extremely common, but after high profile cases like Raj Rajaratnam of Galleon Group, they have become more savvy . The only thing worse than being caught insider trading /doping in sports, is beating someone who did it in sports .  Insider trading gets you huge money, doesn\u2019t get your hands dirty and if you\u2019re with the right set, is very hard to be caught and punished completely on. Only about 55,000 total in the world .  When you reach a certain level, a level where advantages from being an insider could be obtained they start to track daily your ownership of securities, your business relationships with financial firms and other related interested parties . Firms have entire teams dedicated to this task and the control doesn\u2019t end with the employee of the firm, it extends to their spouse and children . The consequences of being \u201coffside\u201d can be extreme .  At least 535 people are in it for sure... and who knows how many others in the other 2 branches... then you add in the various agencies and staffers who are in on it . It's actually a hard crime to get caught for unless you're in a position under the microscope .  It's like doping in the Olympics. Most people do it, but no one admits it . It's everywhere and not very regulated around the globe. The penalties are large and enforcement harsh .  The right question is: Does it happen in such a way that the market for those stocks? If that were the case, then the lead up to earnings would be strongly predictive of what actually happens on earnings .",

        "selftext": "I'm not looking for another debate about whether Nvidia deserves its valuation -- we've had tons of threads about that already. What I'm curious about is:\n\n* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).\n\n* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)\n\nHere's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:\n\n* \u201cI\u2019m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion \u2014 very very hard,\u201d said Schmidt, adding that he\u2019s a \u201cclose friend\u201d to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\n* \u201cIf $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a stock recommendation.\u201d Schmidt didn\u2019t say if he owns Nvidia shares.\n\n* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google\u2019s lax work culture in the session.\n\n* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won\u2019t be the only winner in AI, but there aren\u2019t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can\u2019t spend as freely.\n\n* \u201cAt the moment, the gap between the frontier models \u2014 there are only three \u2014 and everyone else appears to be getting larger,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cSix months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\n* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company\u2019s CUDA programming language. He said AMD\u2019s software that translates Nvidia\u2019s CUDA code for its own chips \u201cdoesn\u2019t work yet.\u201d\n\n* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion. In addition to startup investing, he has been a philanthropist and advised several government committees on technology.",

Schmidt: \"If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market\"",
        "summarized_comments": " Google's decision to pay for service exclusivity is has it in hot water right now with the government . Would Eric Musk be a good CEO for an AI company? Musk says he would be a great at mentoring young founders and stop the company from getting killed by microsoft .  Nvidia is going to be at the center of the AI gold rush for the foreseeable future . Nvidia bag holders downvote: \"I'm comfortable with keeping it as my top holding (15% of my portfolio)  OpenAI told me I can use cheezewiz in lieu of radiator fluid in my car, so needless to say I'm extremely bullish on AI. The products will get better, but the bottleneck is consumption .  AI is not going away or slowing down at all and it is just getting started . Things aren\u2019t going to be perfect right away, and they will only get better/more efficient going forward . We might be in an AI bubble, similar to the .com bubble . Summarization not available for this chunk.  AMD is getting boxed out of supply for hbm especially but that can't last forever when there's a massive interest in ending Nvidia's monopoly pricing and billions pouring in for their chips . AMD is putting forward supply for NNN billions in spending essentially millions of devices .  By responding with \u201cThe? I don\u2019t understand what you mean\u201d, this person is likely mocking the original questioner . They\u2019re mimicking the act of asking about the meaning of a common phrase by pretending to ask about an even more basic and universally understood word (\u201cThe\u201d) This mockery serves to emphasize how obvious the meaning should be in that context .  If AI bubble pops fully then Nvidia will crash the hardest imo (which I don't think will happen since AI is useful but not as much as hyped). No way is gaming going to justify anywhere near that and Nvidia data centers are being used for AI as well . The explosion to 3T was purely due to AI .  Waymo is the leader in FSD so why would he say they\u2019re behind in AI? He may be referring to the next-gen \"video LLM\" models for self driving, which have so far shown to be transformative . Tesla\u2019s adaptive cruise control has been in many accidents while the Waymo Driver is chugging along at a much higher success rate .  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASdaq: AMZN) are the top tech companies . IBM (NYSE: IBM) is the top five most promising tech companies in the world . Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Alphabet, IBM and IBM all have high-flying tech companies that are hyped .",

Google has some amazing long term bets and is undervalued imo. The stock would be up 30% on this news. That's waymo than last quarter.  Public transportation generally does not make a profit from its riders . Waymo is not like LLMs because it requires a physical product to make sense to operate in a market .  A self driving business is at least 10x more complicated than that . Google has the mapping data which is cheaper and cheaper to create and they have the software which is getting easier and easier to make . Just the data collection will take companies years, not to mention the operation side of the business .  Uber, Uber, Tesla, Alibaba, BYD, and even Microsoft can all throw their hats in the ring in the next couple years followed up by local cab companies a couple years later . The hardware isn\u2019t the bottleneck, the software is the bottleneck .  There is no moat once another company starts self driving they will sell their services at a loss to gain market share . Tesla will solve robotaxi at some point in the future and Waymo won\u2019t have the opportunity to be profitable because they will still be competing with traditional taxis .  The bots don't ever have to do city driving, just travel from one terminal on the outskirts to another and back . Regulation and insurance are the only hold ups. The problem is not the tech but the regulations .  The advantage you think doesn't exist and I'd bet you the data now for Waymo passenger's isn't women who want to feel safe, it's male tech nerds who love to embrace new tech . If it works, capitalism will force it to spread .  Waymo is much worse than human drivers and can\u2019t troubleshoot and gets stuck all the time . Waymo's only qualm is that it does sometimes stop suddenly at a yellow, it seems programed to not go through a yellow at all .  Waymo's approach will simply never scale to work nationwide. It takes WAY too long and requires constant updates as roads/etc. change. I don't see how Waymo ever recoups all the billions pumped into it overtime with their current approach .  Tesla fanboys don't understand that Waymo geofences and generates high definition maps to increase reliability . Waymo might just kick Tesla's ass for a long time, but eventually automation in every industry wins out, so an approach like Tesla's or similar will scale better .  Waymo might be paying off its car investment in 2 years, and making profit per car of 50k/year thereafter . That's only about 2% of Lyfts annual revenue, but of course Waymo is active in very few areas . Global taxi market size is valued at USD 203B in 2022 .  Craycray asks why isn't this bigger news and why isn\u2019t it being rolled out to other cities/countries? \"This is not about just replacing Uber or Taxis. It is about a completely change in the behavior of people,\" he says . Summarization not available for this chunk.  The best most liveable cities are walkable/good public transport/ good cycling infrastructure . Tesla is still far behind on self driving being fully usable but waymo is already at a production level .  The company is saying that they have 700 cars doing an average of more than 20 rides per car/ per day . It\u2019s the company self reporting . The company self-reporting . It is similar to the US jobs data of the last 8 months .",

This may come back to bite Powell in the ass.  The average consumer can't afford a home right now, so they aren't buying . That leaves a lot of home sales to people who CAN afford homes - which tend to be wealthier people paying cash . Existing home sales are on par with the bottom of 2008's crash .  The Fed has a dual mandate: promote maximum employment and stable prices . Lower rates will help stimulate the economy and get the money moving again . The first 25 basis points heralds the start of the rate cutting cycle . This signals the direction where rates will go .  The economy is not showing signs of a recession, and inflation is moderating . The Fed will absolutely not allow overall prices to literally decline . The inflation story has been over for two years, it's just that what we did see was so bad that it's so bad .  Inflation is how you get depressions and they're not down for that . People want higher for longer for whatever reason I can't fathom . People see the inflation in their face, but the gov is like \"inflation? What inflation?\"  The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe . Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. The market is split between 25bps and 50bps .  People are fearing (by \"people\" here, i mean the general public) that a recession will come if we dont lower rates . However, we are just teetering at a good inflation rate . If rates are cut, borrowing will increase once again, spending will increase .  The Fed should have kept it open depending on how it looks with the most recent data, they will drop rates or leave it . It sounds like they are almost SURE they will be droping it based on the current/previous data .  Housing prices will rise as rates go down, people will refinance and low supply will just push prices higher . I\u2019ll be amazed if fed pulls off a soft landing, it\u2019s such a big ship to balance. I do agree we need more concrete proof inflation won\u2019t come back after we cut rates .  The Fed is expecting that we're at the point where the economy is finally turning and unemployment is rising outside of expectations . The market again is wrong about interest rate cute timing for the 10th time in a row . The Fed has not reached 2% inflation, nor is unemployment still at the target .  The Fed has surprised the market plenty of times, and rate cuts have been priced in before . I think they'll hold high until inflation hits target . If there's no pushback tomorrow, then it's game, set, match. They cut rates expect homes, cars, insurance and yes even food to skyrocket 10-20% overnight .",

Google is in for some serious headwinds if you ask me. Its main source of revenue is being attacked from every angle and they don\u2019t seem to be winning . The medium to long term risks include adverse outcome in antitrust litigation and risk that AI will displace text based web searches .  Google is OK, to be honest I think Microsoft will be a better long play . YouTube is holding strong for now. Google has access to most of the web, lots of emails, video, maps and navigation info/patterns etc and they have bunch of computing power .  If you want to buy in then now is the time while the rest of the market is fearful . META seems slightly cheaper and AMZN is clearly undervalued in my opinion if you consider big tech .  Google seems like a decent buy right now but I wouldn't want to overcommit to any single stock . Google has a moat in SEO that competitors are trying to cover in SEO .  Google is one of the most analyzed and closely monitored stocks in the world, its price is likely to be as accurate as possible given what is known about it . The company may do well in the next 3 years, but you never know if WW3 or some other black swan event happens that crashes the market in the short term .  $100K represents 5% of my brokerage account, and about 1/70th of my entire savings . It's my largest position by far and I'll be celebrating end this year when this sub will start asking \"Is it time to buy Paypal again?\" when share price hits $90 . Google has been lollygagging at below s&amp;p multiple for a long time .  The market does not expect GOOGL to move up any time soon, and certainly not rapidly . Google is just really well positioned for what is coming over the next decade . Once folks start using AI ChatGPT, etc, they will stop using Google .  ChatGPT's aim is not to make money with the current CHATGPT chatbot playground . It's good that they got subscription and signups but that's not their aim from the start since (1) is not sustainable, and (2) using the chatbots are incredibly niche . They profit more from API usage, finetuning requests not thru their ChatGpt platform which is actually more of a playground than anything else .  Google's AI strat IMO sucks. They profit way more from API usage, finetuning requests not thru their ChatGPT platform . Only acceptable option play based on your thesis would be cash secured puts, and even then I think you\u2019re better off just buying and holding shares and collecting the dividend .",

It's not really practical for every tv maker to roll their own roku like platform and have a team dedicated to keeping it up to date. The future is probably bleak for this company.  Roku makes money on advertising between shows on its own channel, hosting 10,000 channel agreements, and even which \u201cspecial buttons\u201d come on the remote . Roku interface is far-and-away the best among internet TVs . The simplicity and availability is hard to beat .  The fund manager was praised like a God back in 2021, but is now this sub\u2019s enemy number one . He says she's now being criticized for her religious beliefs . The fund is more about investors chasing performance .  Coinbase was one of my best investments ever, haha. It allows users to make crypto-to-crypto transactions and place market, limit and stop orders . The same is basically true in reverse. Almost any company can be a good investment if you get it cheap enough .  OP makes a claim with no sources, but seems plausible . Not at all clear that she has better results than the average all-U.S. index fund manager . She invests in \"disrupters\", which is the equivalent of penny stock investing, but with higher price tags .  Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Investment Management, has made several notable investment decisions that starkly contrasted with the broader hedge fund consensus, often leading to significant losses . Wood's timing has often been criticized, such as the purchase of UiPath shares just before a significant earnings drop, leading to a nearly 40% decline in the stock .  For those who like to test their market prediction skills without risking real money, I've found Stonks: after earnings prediction game pretty fun .

        "summarized_selftext": " The new Starbucks CEO is supposedly going to be commuting from California to Seattle everyday . Will it be orders of magnitude cheaper for him to relocate and won't it be better for company/employee morale?",
        "summarized_comments": " Starbucks has a deeper issue in that whole premise they were founded on (the 3rd place) died with mobile ordering . I'll pay $6 for a quality drink and nice cafe/patio, but not to pick up a coffe as I walk to work . The success of mobile ordering destroyed the brand, so its a big problem to tackle .  Target hurt themselves with too many empty shelves and by locking up too many items . Target lost a good chunk of customers going all in on weird alphabet swimwear for kids . Starbucks has a real crony problem when it comes to filling managerial positions .  The CEO's $10M bonus is pegged on performance, I have no issues as a stockholder . Let them prove their mettle and take the wins, says John Rambo . Starbucks can choose to not pay, but then they won't get him .  He lives in California and has a family . Starbucks had to offer him a better deal than he was getting from Chipotle already . He will still be expected to work from the Seattle office at least three days a week .  The cost of the private jet is **insignificant** if he can turn the company around! We're talking about a $10 million cost per year versus a potential $10 billion increase in the company's value .  Reddit user asks: What's the argument that Starbucks has more of an impact on people\u2019s lives than Chipotle? He says he didn't intend to compare Starbucks and Chipotle . Reddit is a publicly traded company .  Despite the remuneration, why should he fly private every day on company's account? It's not his private hedge fund company. He can commute in a space shuttle on his own dime for all I care as a stockholder .  His salary plus plane usage will most likely end up being less than 0.25% of that over his stay at the company assuming he stays about 5 years and meets results to get bonuses . Starbucks went up by about 24% almost instantly .  The value he brought to shareholders just by being hired is worth more than any costs he plans to cut . SBUX owns a jet and maintains a staff for it, so while I'm sure this will probably increase the budgeted hours of flight from last year, it's probably not going to be by much .  Every Starbucks share owner is celebrating this hire with this hire, he says . The cost of this guy flying around won\u2019t even register as a rounding error . He will work from where ever he wants or needs depending on the business .  At this point the restaurants are so chaotic with commonly long queue that they can grow revenue and profit faster by making the restaurants serve more customers than they can by opening more restaurants . But efficiency isn\u2019t just \u201cdo more with less\u201d - just \u2018do more\u201d is an improvement in efficiency .  The CEO will be in the office 3 days a week when not traveling for work . He will probably arrive Tuesday morning and leave Thursday night . He is a union buster at Chipotle .  The amount of angst at this guy's pay and benefits is absurd . This guy is so highly perceived that his announcement raised SBUX's market cap by 20B . He is not \u201ccommenting from California to Seattle\u201d that\u2019s patently false if you just read the article .  The CEO needs to stay connected beyond office hours with top employees in the HQ . He will conform to the hybrid work from home policy everyone loves\u2026be in the office at least 3 days a week\u2026just fly there .  The OP is earning janitorial salary and worries about how CEO should conduct his work . His job is to get paid a lot to close stores, reduce headcount, and cut costs . It doesn't make sense if you think his job was to make Starbucks \"better\"  Everyone here is against these companies, but offer any of them $25m to do a job and watch what they do...Cost cutting, what me must do; not for *me*, just for *you*.",

For beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) Please direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads .  Google's exclusivity contracts with other companies such as Apple created an unfair advantage as they ( Google) have an 84% market share and that is stifling competition .  An ex-googler who quit on his own terms says Google needs a strong engineer as a CEO, not some glorified PM like this guy . Google cloud division execs are pretty much ex-Oracle mafia. Cloud has more headcount then rest of the company .  Pichai is one of the highest paid CEOs of all time . He's extremely fortunate to have inherited such a dominant business revenue model . Google stock is up 500% since he took over as CEO .  Pichai is that he\u2019s too close to engineering as a product manager background . The company needs a strong rebranding expert. The biggest issue is that we have a ton of old guys that have no business being in charge, still in charge .  Pichai's whole career is just being at the right place right time, he says . Google engineers took care of the rest and he certainly didn't mess it . He is a terrible CEO for any American corporate. He's simply one very very lucky faker .  The entire market has been down since 10 July and GOOG is not an exception . General sentiment has been negative since there are more recession fears . GOOGL is up 18% YTD and has outperformed MSFT even with AMZN .  Google as a search engine is miles ahead of any other search engine . AI search sucks and doesn't answer most questions properly unless it's factual . Google could (will?) be back at $200 by end of year and you could ask the same question .  Google Pixels are losing value faster than any other phone, that's why I bought mine used in pristine condition for half the retail price less than a year after its launch . The only thing that keeps people with Pixel is the OS, courtesy of Google's Android development and camera . They've consistently had the lowest P/E of Mag 7 companies, with the occasional exception of META .  The stock dropped like a rock after the earnings came out, it was that one time I decided to \"risk it\" I timed this very well with Microsoft - -11% and -16% down . Because I bought befor earnings \u2026 so it needed to drop like that .  Google lawyers will show that many of their business has some form of competition but Google is simply better . They will either have to adopt less anticompetitive ways like Microsoft, or be broken up . The street and politicians knew about the anti-trust breakup way before we did. It\u2019s like 1+1&gt;2. It is was it is when something is that good. The company has very high expectations .  Google dropped on earnings which were underwhelming for YouTube ad revenues and no sign of when AI investment will pay off . The company is only going to be more valuable in the long run than if they had stayed together .  Google has been found by the court to be a monopoly, the government will be moving in to break them up . Google hasn't really done anything new or interesting, or anything that really makes money aside from ads . The breakup of Standard Oil happened during John D. Rockefeller's lifetime .  The market just lost confidence in Google . Google.com: \"Why did GOOG drop from $200 in July?\u201d This inquiry will give you much more reliable results than Reddit responses like \u201cMr. Market\u201d",

The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.\n\nThe computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.\n\n\u201cAI systems are our number one strategic priority,\u201d AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nThe addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.\n\n\u201cThe main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,\u201d Su said.\n\nAMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.\n\nAMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.\n\nZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD\u2019s data center chief, Forrest Norrod.\n\nThe closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.\n\nExecutives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company\u2019s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company\u2019s customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\n\nAMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company\u2019s adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/19/amd-to-acquire-server-builder-zt-systems.html",

One severe shortcoming of AMD's offering is their lack of integrated AI server proper .  NVIDIA isn't just the hardware alone . Intel is easier to topple since they are already sinking and that their architecture isn't as tied in to AI . There are way more dependencies than just selling new clusters of AMD cloud .  AMD's market share is already increasing naturally in the CPU market . They also don't need to beat Nvidia to grow exponentially as a company . Nvidia will most likely not be able to keep up with demand for AI GPU chips .  AMD has no existing tech right now in cloud GPUs that developers even use for training and deploying AI models . Intel isnt being riddled with regulations now that it is dominating the cloud CPU battle that are paired with NVIDIA . AMD investors need to be very wary of TPUs from Google .  The most upvoted comment in this thread is someone agreeing, because of the way you act . AMD is flat - and the reason will persist, and no one should expect them to .  AMD will still see success, especially in tight margin applications like consoles, but that's same old story for them . AMD currently produces only the bottom layer, relying on purchasers or 3rd parties to integrate and provide the software interface .",

Politicians promise one thing and then do the opposite . European auto manufacturers would have gotten their lunch eaten in the rest of the world if they had a closed garden at home .  In pre-2015, it was widely expected that the Japanese and Koreans battery makers would dominate the battery manufacturing with some European, eg, BASF, in the mix . Remember that Japan pioneered and dominated the lithium ion battery industry since SONY's first successful commercialization in the early 90's; then followed by South Korea (eg, LG, Samsung, SK) Most EV OEMs around the world were already working with them when China locked foreign battery makers out of their market .  Tesla received CNY 2.1 billion ($325 million) in government subsidies for new energy vehicles, the highest amount granted to a carmaker in the country . The EU is therefore seeking to leveo the playing field by cancelling out subsidies with tariffs .  Anti-China rhetoric is ingrained in people who think anything China does is unfair and wrong . Some people seriously have it so engrained in them that only *their* country is allowed to be a dominant superpower and use their economic weight .  China's long had anticompetitive, discriminatory policies against foreign EV battery competitors since 2015 up until the end of the EU's investigation period . The US's response is slightly different, but is likewise allowed under their own laws to protect themselves however they see fit from China's violations . There are two very specific types of subsidies prohibited under China's WTO obligation .  The European Commission has said that other companies that cooperate with the EU's investigation into China's high subsidies for electric cars will face tariffs of 21.3 percent . That rate is higher than the 20.8 percent that cooperating companies would have faced in July .",

Surely, you\u2019re more intelligent than the collective wisdom of millions of other investors.\n\nHow hard can it really be to beat the market?\n\n**2. Consistently try to time the market.**\u00a0Think and act in extremes. Go all in when it feels like the market is in a good place. Get out of the market when things seem dicey. Keep jumping in and out until you are rich.\n\nAnyone can do it.\n\n**3. Chase performance.**\u00a0Follow the hot hand. Invest with the star fund manager the financial media just fell in love with. Follow fads. Take tips on the hottest stocks.\n\nThere\u2019s no luck involved in short-term outperformance. It\u2019s all skill.\n\n**4. Fight the last war.**\u00a0Hedge the huge risk that just happened. Buy the Black Swan fund after the huge crash just occurred. Invest in that inflation hedge after prices have already skyrocketed. Make the decisions you wish you would have made before you lost money.\n\nDriving in the rearview mirror feels safe so it should work, right?\n\n**5. Take investment advice from billionaires.**\u00a0When billionaires go on financial television or share their thoughts on the markets or the economy they are talking directly to you. They know your financial circumstances, risk tolerance and time horizon. They follow the exact same investment strategy as you. They never change their minds or make statements to the financial press they don\u2019t actually believe.\n\nWhat\u2019s the harm in buying some puts just like George Soros or Stanley Druckenmiller?\n\nBillionaires are just like us!\n\n**6. Worry more about being right than making money.**\u00a0Who cares about your investment results? Intellectual superiority is where it\u2019s at. You don\u2019t need to worry about investment performance when you can complain about government debt levels, blame the Fed for doing away with free markets, and rail against politicians all day long.\n\nJust keep reading Zero Hedge. That oughta fix everything.\n\n**7. Benchmark your portfolio to the best-performing asset class.**\u00a0Who cares about diversification when there is always one asset class, strategy or sector outperforming?\n\nSpend your days second-guessing that you don\u2019t have more money invested in the asset class with the best short-term performance. Then take all of your money and invest it in the best performer.\n\nSimply repeat this strategy over and over again.\n\nIt has to work eventually, correct?\n\n**8. Blame the Fed when you underperform.**\u00a0When you\u2019re right it\u2019s pure skill. When you\u2019re wrong, it\u2019s all the Fed\u2019s fault.\u00a0 The system would have collapsed if it hadn\u2019t been for Greenspan, Bernanke, Yellen and Powell.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about introspection following a bad prediction about the end of the financial system as we know it.\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong just early.\n\n**9. Live and die by the short-run.**\u00a0No one has time for the long-run. The sure path to riches in the markets comes from following every economic data point, earnings release, headline, financial news story and insane social media conspiracy theory.\n\nYou need to stay on top of this stuff so you can react in real-time.\n\nIt\u2019s not like the market prices this stuff in.\n\n**10. Sell all of your stocks in a bear market.**\u00a0Bear markets are far too painful to sit through. After stocks nosedive, sell your stocks and wait for the coast to clear.\n\nHow hard can it be to pick bottoms?\n\n**11. Assume you\u2019re the next Warren Buffett.**\u00a0The guy is from Nebraska. Just memorize some of his folksy quotes and read a book or two about his investment style.\n\nPicking stocks is easy!\n\n**12. Overreact to market volatility.**\u00a0Volatility is scary. Panic. Change your portfolio. Abandon your asset allocation, diversification be damned.\n\nThere is no time for critical thinking. Act first, think later.\n\n**13. Be pessimistic about everything.**\u00a0Optimism is for gullible people. Everything is always bad. The world is falling apart.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of investing in a world that\u2019s gone to hell?\n\n**14. Investing is boring. Just speculate!**\u00a0Trade zero-days options. Gamble. Shoot the moon. The markets are rigged anyway.\n\nWhy even try?\n\n**15. Try to become rich overnight.**\u00a0Forget your goals. Delayed gratification is for losers.

The average retail investor underperforms the SP500 by relatively little, but ETF fundamentalists describe stock picking as buying Powerball tickets . There's gotta be some middle ground between WSB and Bogleheads .  R/Investing is that way, unfortunately. But to suggest one cannot beat the indices with strategic investments in individual leading stocks is foolish. The main reason most people lose money is because they either sell out of fear when a stock dips or play with options and trading .  The sure path to riches in the markets comes from following every economic data point, earnings release, headline, financial news story and insane social media conspiracy theory .

The federal funds rate only became a range in December 2008 as part of the GFC response . Any 12.5 bp adjustment could be enacted via open market (the 'OM' of FOMC) operations . The optics of 50 right before election won't fly .  The Fed has started cutting cycles with 50 bps cuts going back 25 years I believe . That\u2019s because all cuts over the last 25yrs have been reactionary (see a clear slowdown in growth) This is a proactive cut. Not saying a 50bp cut is impossible in Sep., but it's unlikely .

Kicking myself for not doing more, and kicking myself for pulling half out after it first doubled.  Intel is a classic pump and dump and dump-and-short it then short it then . If I had just bought and held my shares and options that I had for a while I would have made over 70k. The hard part is discerning whether it is a regarded theory, or the next holy grail .  The hype is super high but I still expect a bit of a market correction so I'll buy back in with some of my profit . I'm playing with chump change compared to a lot of people on the sub but making a couple thousand in profit is still awesome .  Intel guy is definitely sharing the first place with this fella ! The stock was at an all time low and basically couldn\u2019t go any lower I thought, i felt that they would eventually have to announce a launch date that would surely bring the stock up from where it was sitting in the 2s .  Im up 4K on it today, just put in a trailing stop loss order set at 10% down . If too far from the current price, the stop loss is more likely to be triggered by a sudden but massive downturn . Once the rug-pull is out the way, it will be a solid investment until~2030 .  Spacemob holders (myself included) are in this for the long haul . You have to realize those gains before you made anything . But buying 3 BTC with credit is even wilder .  The only spac that worked was the one that wanted to sell space telephones or some shit. Its all magic in the wind until then. The gains without a single successful launch, and a ho hum earnings?  ASTS has had numerous derisking events the past few months and the revenue potential (while currently theoretical for a little longer) is mind blowing to the point of feeling delusional while at the same time maybe being realistic . MNOs worldwide are now desperate to get a piece of this pie . SpaceX sabotaged the launch to make sure that ASTS fails and Starlink never gets anything close to a compeditor.

He will only be able to avoid a loss if the SP is below $115.62 .  Options are also good for hedging . They have their place in a prudent portfolio but people want to YOLO grandma's money . The best video to explain options is from InTheMoney youtube channel .  The price of the option is linked to the stock price. then there's extra shit like time value, implied volatility, all of that stuff is linked together and the options price is constantly moving during the live auction market . The only thing that matters is the option price moving . when the stock has big moves in a short amount of time the option prices move accordingly .

Most of that's in ccetfs so at least the account is generating its own money to lose :)  Jensen Huang has a fairly good shot of hitting the $1 million bet with expiration next Friday . The return can be tempting, enormous, and likely, but in the end it might be just out of reach enough to turn your money into nothing .  The Intel guy lost 28% on puts and put all his inheritance on a stock and lost a chunk of it under a week . He could've put it in Nvidia, Apple, AMfuckingD, or even better, diverse between them all, but no, fucking intel. He takes the fucking cake .  Op options probably heading straight to zero with options that decay with no time and have no monetary value after 8/30\u2026 I\u2019m going to take this guy over Intel dork any day of the week, but he is betting on a dip, dips happen all the time, intel could be actually dead .  Buying puts for the week of NVIDIA's earning is crazy . You could have sold making $25k total profit today. 30% loss or gain with NVDA is nothing .",

        "summarized_selftext": "",
        "summarized_comments": " If only there was a place where an *American company* could find qualified engineers without relying on china *or* India . Our Indian team has expanded dramatically, and now NA colleagues are tasked with \"reviewing\" their work, which translates to full re-writes .  Companies in the U.S. are increasingly moving positions to India, including roles in data science, analytics, and finance, due to significant salary differences . A Senior Data Scientist in the US. earns $110,000-160,000 annually, while in India, the salary is about $19,000 to 24,000 .  There really is no cost saving at all from outsourcing to India, in my experience . The amount of Indian students that constantly get caught cheating is outrageous as well is outrageous . Execs want to see cost savings and strategic offloading of work packages .  ChatGPT users have to wait for a response from an Indian person to respond to their messages . If it is not responding at all, your AI is on lunch break . The good engineers in India usually are trying to leave .  The average joe (or probably  better Santosh) is usually forced to work in the average IT consultancy company which is also focusing only on getting millions of engineers hired, with low pay and where quality does not matter, still living a better life than 3/4 of the Indian population .  The US tech industry is full of absolute regards who are on bloated salaries doing terrible work, they\u2019re going to find out soon that someone in SEA can do their job for 1/5th of the cost, possibly even myself .  Boeing cheaped out on the 737 MAX ACAS software, paying Indian developers $9 an hour, killing all the people in 2 planes . The work culture over there is very much about appearance and ass kissing which seems nice at first but it's a disaster waiting to happen .  The ones who pay for it are the workers and nobody that gives a shit about them has any power to do anything about it . The problem with recruitment agencies is that they require people with heavy sales experience to constantly bring in new clients, so they don't necessarily hire people with skills in the field they're recruiting for . Intel does is fire 1 US engineer thinking they can hire 3-5 indian engineers to do the same task .  Most people think Indian engineers are cheaper in salary, but for a lot of these places the reality is that the salary is equitable but work is trash and Americans move to look for something better . Boeing knows they will just get a bailout. The needful won't just go do itself- hence Boeing doing the needful!  Harvard case study on Boeing has to include, \u201cWhat changed as the result of moving  the HQ from Washington to South Carolina that brought down this one time giant?\u201d Typical old school business mindset from the 80s. Compromising on critical parts of the product to save money and drive up profits .  There is a hard core of Indian engineers from the tier 1 and some tier 2 universities that IME just smash Western graduates . The cream of the Indian engineering crop, again generally speaking, is already living in California and already working for Big Tech on an H1-B .  The Boeing office in Vancouver is literally all Indians . Boeing is easily considered the Ford or GM of airplanes and that\u2019s absolutely not a compliment . This is a piece of garbage journalism. It actually makes sense once you read the article .  The comments are pure unadulterated racism and xenophobia . Boeing is hiring out of India due to the inability to poach workers from China .",

He was using his stock for short term loans on big bets and paying them back before the movement was supposed to be reported . He basically hid is $2B risk, not steal it from anyone or deprived people of $2 billion .  If he were a lawyer doing the same thing with client money he would be disbarred . He didn't report his margin loans to the SEC as he's a 5%+ shareholder . He settled because legal fees are more expensive than just paying a fine .  US securities laws require parties with over 5% direct or indirect beneficial ownership of certain equities to disclose certain transactions, including pledges, involving those equities . The fine should be that much *per incidence* not a package discount on all illegal activities .  Carl Icahn put up his company stock for a margin loan and for what ever reason did not file the right reports . Icahn was able to repay the margin loan, but the fine is hardly a rounding error . The wall street is essentially worthless if he can bet against his own company .  Icahn and IELP will pay a combined $2 million in fines . The only crime was not reporting it, which is why he got off with a slap on the wrist . A 2 million fine that requires them to admit guilt is not a punishment .  A $2 million fine for failure to disclose $5 billion in margin loans? That's like if you didn't disclose a $25k loan and received a $10 fine for it... what a laughable amount . The billionaire settled the agreement fine, neither admitting nor denying, hired a good lawyer, people let you turn disasters into blessings .",

It's in anticipation of the satellite launch next month .  The Reddit user is a bot and this action was performed automatically . Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns .  The pain of taking small profits and missing out on larger profits is more tolerable than the pain of holding on after a rally and not selling before it crashes and wipes out all or most of the profit .  The tech they have has always been incredible, it went up to $20+ after going public . It then went down to $2 because everyone thought management were regards - like actively trying to ruin the company, they became a massive short target . They spent 2 years 'secretly' building a moat with patents, signing pre-agreements with almost every major MNO on earth . The sats they're putting up will be compatible with 6G, Starlink can't currently deliver 4G reliably .  At least 1 brokerage, at least temporarily, ran out of shares to short today . It's very possible that institutions were buying up everything they could today . The company is in a good position, executing and getting close to commercial service .  ASTS has been steadily going up so I don't see it going below $20 but I also think it'll go down a bit . When I get paid next month the satellites will have launched and it'll be $250 a share . The business report they sent out yesterday just rehashed the news articles of the past month or so .  ASTS is way overbought, and will be diluted with warrant redemption very soon . The company will call the warrants for redemption if it is trading for over $18 for 20 of 30 trading days to limit your upside . When warrants are redeemed, new shares are issued, and cash is received by the company .  The launch might be delayed, so I could see ASTS trading sideways for a bit . It's up 800% in 3 months so I expect some pullback, but its also trading like a meme stock . Fidelity can write against them with Fidelity if the warrants are ITM .  The company is pre-revenue and had been on a strong upward trajectory, indicating that the story/narrative is driving the price . Once the satellites are up and running, ASTS will go from having almost zero revenue and negative profits to billions in revenue and profits nearly overnight .  Whenever work gets stressful, these memes really make my day. I can't stop laughing. Once Lilium is on the move\u2026I will get my rewards. I was in at 5$ and chickened out at $4.",

Every day trading strategy comes down to pattern recognition with extra steps . Recognizing a pattern and working off it isn't rocket surgery . Long term investing is more about knowing the company you're investing in .  An option trader has been using short term plays to make more money to blow on options . The contract he bought was cheap- it was 0.15$ (100 shares at 15 cents each) The contract spiked up to 1.15 (115$ /contract) because the jump in the price of the stock itself caused the contract to be more valuable .  OP bought 1010 contracts for $15 a contract . Price went up, Contracts became valuable, and are now worth $115 per contract . Because the contracts value increased by a dollar, someone owning the contract has profit sitting there .  The most risky investment i\u2019ve made thus far is $200 into RKLB at open today . Approximately a 15% increase in the stock price caused the contracts to 8x in price essentially . That seems crazy crazy crazy volatile .Yeah- it\u2019s because the options are operating on a basis of 100 shares, not one .  Options are meant for people hedging actually stock positions . Some people use them to gamble their 401k and children\u2019s futures . The rest of us call them lottery tickets instead of lottery tickets .  Options are not about the markets per se. It\u2019s pure gambling and addiction, it's pure gambling, addiction . OTM calls appreciate in value as they get closer to the strike and depreciate as the expiry approaches .  He flipped (traded) the option, then resold it when it became more valuable . It\u2019s all just a coin flip, but rapid movements and high IV definitely favor OTM contracts . Each dollar the stock increases the option exponentially goes up which factors into the huge gains .  The people's champion has a solid plan for its business and it may hit ASTS any soon! He bought three,1010 buys, bought 1010 contracts, that's 101 000 shares worth, if those were actual shares .  RKLB has only begun the transformation from a great turnaround case to a meme stock. Expect $100 soon. The company has been prime for purchase like 6-Months\u2026 Iv been buying this for like a year.. the pump is because ASTS.. so people just went to mirror company and bought it .",

A lot of ppl just got stupid with the numbers and lose $12k in one play and ask \u2018whhhhy\u2019 But that\u2019s not the point. $70 is a great start, but until you know what you want out of this you can\u2019t really play .  The market, IMO, is way too volatile\u2026 I feel that it could spike up a bit after ER, but the large fall that dumped it all the way to $90 is to concerning, RN at least . I started trading about 4 years ago with $7k from a job I got fired from (the OG 401k money) Turned it into $100k (in about 8months) and kinda just washed it away .  I'm bullish for the climb to the ER. But I feel, even after ER if it\u2019s climbs up, we will have a few billion rug pullers that will capitalize on their gains causing a bit of a stir . I joined the Reddit to just keep up with POTENTIALS that could be worth (asts)  You just need to plan your plays and ride them out accordingly, that\u2019s as simple as it gets . As Iv said, I got a huge bag in nvdia, I will sell as we climb up (hopefully) to earnings.. then leave a bit for ER then .  You can't make ALL the money, period... so if you're making a lot and you do it a few times without the all or nothing risk next day, it probably works out better in the long run when done consistently .

The more \"it's *okay* the food was to begin with, the worse the impact when prices ramped .  Subway should charge under $8.50 after tax, not $12 and $15 where they currently are . Franchisees were losing money on it back then they've got to charge even more then that just to break even today . Subway needs to make changes to make it so without sacrificing food quality .  There is no world in which a $15 sub is reasonable . Subway using 2-4oz of bargain brand Oscar Meyer cold cuts cost $1.50-3 to make . Subway has been running excellent promos for like 4 of the last 5 months .  Most immigrants in Canada these days are from a single country and mostly from single state within that country . Can get the money via loans in home country . $12 for a 6\" combo is $3-4 more than it out to be. $5 combos for the cheap basic 6\" sandwiches that almost no one actually orders .  Subway better figure something out because people aren't going to keep paying $10-12 for a 6\" combo and $15 for a foot long . A corner deli in NYC will grill you up fresh chicken and put avocado in your sandwich for $12 .  Subway has overhead, but at that price, a visit there is a treat . It's odd, the corporation, beholden to shareholders, doesn't REALLY care about the franchisees, even though they are the workhorses .  The $11 meal deal is our go to these days. Sitdown restaurants are now running me about $25 for a full meal + tip. I get Subway GCs for 20% off at Costco. Most days, I pay maybe $10-12 on average .  The menu revamp took subs from around $12 for a footling to $18 here in Canada . The franchise is reckless when it comes to approving locations. They just want to skim their 8% of gross sales .  The $5 footlongs are not coming back, says one Reddit user . Subways have no value proposition to the customer, he says . They have no business selling sandwiches for $10+.  A footlong today would have to be $9-10 to make the same level of profits . Subway is already being cannibalized... Their \"secret sauces\" are being sold at grocery stores .  Subway sandwiches are trash and they\u2019ve always been trash . Their franchises consistently have the dirtiest, grossest facilities of any fast food chain . For the same amount of money and calories you can get way better food in 100 different places .  Most footlongs are $13+ here in Canada, almost double what they were 5 years ago . They're going to have to do a complete 180 if they want to stay in business . The world is going through an odd time and has caused prices to skyrocket .  The cheapest sub in Asia is $9, and the popular ones (steak and cheese, meatball) are $12 for a steak and cheese in SEA of all places where the average salary is a fraction of the US, you kidding me lmao .  Subway is a last resort option to eat out, and make 5-10x more at home . The quality of food has plummeted while prices have skyrocketed for the past 5 years .  It used to be made fresh daily in the stores but now tastes like it\u2019s a few days old or more . We have now quit going there as of last week .

        "summarized_comments": " Historically, gold has been a sucker's investment. Sure, there are occasional spikes where it outperforms other sectors, but over the long haul if you're holding gold, you're leaving money on the table . The real competitor to gold is short term bonds or HYSA .  Gold tends to peak in times when growth is needed and tends to bottom when inflation is an issue . Gold has been a sucker's investment by far but you're a clown if you think it's a \"sucker's\" investment . The TL;DR is most folks can't predict shit and that's why you have diversification .  Gold's return doesn't touch equities or corporate bonds but it's has been decent against other \"safe\" assets like long or short government bonds . Most people who buy gold aren't dumping their life savings or their entire 401K/IRA/retirement into it . Most investors who hold it likely have a 1-5% in ETF form as an alt hedge to 60/40 .  If the world ever goes to shit, gold isn't going to be even remotely helpful . Gold heavy, inedible, and essentially useless in a survival scenario, it's also not a good material for bartering in the 21st century .  Historically, gold has been a sucker's investment . Gold is a suckers investment with terrible returns . The S&amp;P500 by contrast has consistently beat inflation overtime .  Gold has outperformed spy now in the last 15 or 20 years . Federal reserves across the world are buying up gold at historic levels . It obviously outperforms index funds when timed correctly . 100% stocks is simply too risky for most people .  /r/Investing feels that the subject of finance is best discussed with as little conflict of interest as possible, and we have long held the goal of not becoming a platform for others to profit off new investors . We do not allow to link to subreddit where the moderation team is actively profiting from users .  We went from inflation, to stagflation and now we're on our way to outright deflation . We've been in a deflationary regime since 1992. Technology is deflationary, but people don't really feel it. We're back to where we were prior to covid, but now the entire world is a recession .  For 99% of human history humans have preferred to use money that can\u2019t be printed out of thin air . For obvious reasons, humans can't be trusted with that much power and it will inevitably lead to the system's downfall . The US Dollar became fiat in 1971 when it formally removed the gold backing .  Gold was worth $2700 in 2012 when you adjust for inflation, and it\u2019s $2500 now? Gold is down 7.5% in 12 years while the S&amp;P500 went from 1300 to 5500 or a gain of 323% . Gold is lagging true inflation and this is a perfect storm for it to run .  No one predicted the govts rollout of quantitative easing/QE, which kept the market's propped up way longer than anyone anticipated . The point is that no one knows what is going to happen next . Gold is the best performing asset this year but gold will have its best decade ever .  Gold is seasonal so topping out sometime soon . Bitcoin will outperform gold, which allows for a smaller allocation . I'm glad I bought gold 4 or 5 years ago, but since I am already overweighted in precious metals I'm not buying more .  Bitcoin hit its true all time high as measured in ounces of gold in November 2021 at 36.67 troy oz. of gold and it is currently -35% below that level . The fact that the price of Bitcoin in US dollars is currently around the same level is all due to inflation of the US dollar .  The value of gold has always gone up gradually since the existence of humans . Gold's high in Aug 2014 was $1324.30, given the current price of $2546.20 that\u2019s a 92% increase . Gold has consistently outperformed VT over the past ten years stock market bull run .  Cumulative returns on GLD and VT at ten years, five years, two years, one year, and even YTD so far are higher for GLD . GLD 88% ten year return. VT 85%. GLD tracks the spot price of gold . VT pays dividends 4 times per year and can be reinvested .  War is one of the factors that affect the price of gold, but not the only and not always the most dramatic . Inflation, war, war and inflation are also factors . Gold is good for that. But you can\u2019t wash money from selling weed in the stock market without throwin .",

        "summarized_comments": " No asset is recession proof, not even gold, but Bitcoin is the only asset that can't be seized . Bitcoin's biggest flaw: you have to take responsibility for securing it and there's no one to bail you out .  Bitcoin's value is not necessarily equal to the price of that thing, lol. The safety of traditional currency is an illusion. Real ownership comes with responsibility. You can own a car but if you don't protect it, someone might steal it .  No one wants to admit they\u2019re wrong or not as smart as they credit themselves . I like to ask people, \u201cWhat do you want to know about investing that we can\u2019t know?\u201d The default stance is often to implicitly ignore luck as a factor in financial success .  People forget that in investing decisions, the risk profile is totally different in retrospect than it was looking forward at the time . The jury is still out if BTC can do over the next 50 years what it did over the last 10 years . The world looks very different when you\u2019re investing $1000 into something versus $1,000,000 .  Bitcoin isn't useful in any way, it doesn't have the inherent secrecy that the laundering currencies provide, and it doesn\u2019t execute contracts or record any other information that any of the dApp capable currencies provide . It\u2019s a Ponzi scheme, plain and simple. Bitcoin's accounting practices are completely transparent .  I thought there was some meat to the digital gold thesis at the time and that there was (and still is) a lot of potential for growth by penetration of TAM, when compared to the size of other alternative asset markets . The point isn\u2019t about crypto, though, it\u2019s about being honest with yourself about your mistakes .  Bitcoin has failed to deliver on all its various promises, says expert . Transactions are slow and expensive, and the transaction volume is inherently unscalable . Transactions can't be reversed, no third party can go and edit a \u201crecord\u201d All transactions are public, anyone can see them .  Bitcoin often follows the movement of highly speculative stocks with leverage for bigger shifts both ways . Unlike investing in a stock, you have basically zero true protections, and scammers could steal your \"assets\" at anytime .  Bitcoin gets adopted through booms (followed cyclical busts) triggered by halving . To adopt a monetary technology is BY DEFINITION not something you do for free . The more utility you want to get from it (preservation or increase of value) the more you need to PAY (= INVEST) Financial incentive is only and most effective adoption mechanism .  Bitcoin remains a speculative bubble that has accomplished little on the way to becoming an actual currency . People who see it as an investment will hold, not spend on pizzas and beer . Bitcoin doesn't really offer any benefit over transacting in fiat for most consumers . Bitcoin's narrative of decentralization and trustlessness is mostly a mirage .  Bitcoin is decentralised enough to make it EXTREMELY UNLIKELY that it can be 51% attacked . BTC gives you the OPTION of using end-consumer services . Bitcoin transactions to buy goods, can be instantaneous now, and for fees that are a fraction of a penny .  There is now regulation in pretty much every country in the world, providing the same consumer protection you get when you trade stocks . It's mostly the same regulation on a crypto exchange that you get on a stock exchange . Adoption for just currency usage for purchasing goods alone has been steadily increasing every cycle .  Bitcoin nearly doubled in value between January and April this year, Bitcoin has since dropped about 20% . Bitcoin doesn't double or halve within a day and doesn't even do that within the same week . It has done nothing besides make some of the early adopters rich by convincing other people it has value - and waste a lot of electricity .  Bitcoin's price action is driven by short-term speculation, FOMO, and Greater Fool mechanics, ultimately forming a speculative bubble . Despite having existed for 15 years, real-world adoption is insignificant, with uses largely confined to gambling, illegal transactions, and generating fees for financial intermediaries such as exchanges or fund providers .  Bitcoin is not a hedge against inflation and not a long-term investment while it outperformed every single asset in existence for the past 15 years and by a long shot . Regulators will never be able to stop someone from sending bitcoin from one country to another, whether the bitcoin is exchanged for illegal activities or not .  Bitcoin was created under a set of circumstances that are not likely to occur again and solves the problem of value transfer in a network compromised of bad actors . \"Crypto\" generally refers to unlicensed securities that are centralized and marketed as get rich quick schemes . Bitcoin has the distinction of being truly limited in supply .  Bitcoin has absolute control of the supply side of the equation, and the formula is known . Currently has about a 53% CAGR since inception, making it better than real estate, gold, or just about any other asset other than cherry picked stocks for short windows of time .  Bitcoin is the largest mcap in a growing $2 trillion market . It\u2019s supposedly decentralized and the supply is capped at 21 million. The US prints money like there's no tomorrow with zero talk of spending cuts. The more money that\u2019\ufffds printed, the less the USD may be worth and the higher likelihood of higher inflation . Bitcoin is obviously way riskier than large cap tech stocks .  Bitcoin can be used as a currency and store of value . US dollars lose value every year, so the concept of saving in US dollars doesn't make any sense . This causes us to have to invest in companies like nvidia or else we slowly lose money each year . But, in return this drives up the price of these assets .  Bitcoin is a scam because it is a negative sum game . Miners create their coins and sell them for real money while 'investors' in bitcoin itself get nothing but entries in a database . Some investors may come out ahead, but this is at the expense of many more people putting money into the system . Exchanges are making out like bandits charging fees for every transaction along the way .  The theory behind $BtC is the worlds fiat currencies will print themselves to extreme devaluations against $BTC . The risk of investing in bitcoin is less than investing in a single company if you define risk as investment going to 0 since bitcoin doesn't have a single point of failure and centralized risk .  Bitcoins price relative to goods and services incentives saving over consumption and investment . People are incentivized to hoard the \u201cgood\u201d money in this case bitcoin, and spend the \u2018bad\u2019 money . Bitcoin is a terrible store of value . Fiat currencies undergo inflation, but the inflation is mostly predictable and stable . Bitcoins price in the future is not whatsoever predictable . Asset backed money just kind of sucks .  The dollar is backed by the strongest military, strongest economy with the safest and most robust financial assets in the world, need it to pay taxes, interact with US businesses, used to denominated oil, not to mention its world reserve status . Bitcoin is the world\u2019s first decentralized, proof of work protocol with no known founder/ceo. It is also the most finite, scarce property on the planet .  Bitcoin is how you gamble without having to leave ur house. It\u2019s by definition not investing rather than speculation on whether someone else would be willing to buy this digital asset off you at a higher price than at which you bought it. The only legitimate reason to but Bitcoin is that it *might* be an effective hedge against normal currency .  Bitcoin is king when it comes to crypto, future returns will be less than in the past but could still surpass gold in total mcap . Bitcoin is a store of value, so you own something with a limited supply and as demand increases your holdings will grow .  Bitcoin makes all the sense in the world as a savings vehicle as it hits all the marks of an ideal money . There would be some problems and movement in Bitcoin because its heavily purchased with the dollar and the American economy has more world wide weight than most other countries . With Bitcoin has population rises and more people buy into Bitcoin, the amount of it would actually go up because it would become more rare . Summarization not available for this chunk.  There is a significant portion of the population that feels \"left behind\" by the current economic systems . The majority of those people don't understand the systems at all, but see Crypto as \"the new age\" and simply go into it from that perspective .  There can only be 21 million Bitcoins and it takes expensive computers and a lot of electricity to create a BTC . It is a mathematical exercise in digital scarcity . Every 4 years there is the reward halving, where the amount of Bitcoins rewarded per block mined .",

Like 10% into bonds for a middle-class person is nothing. Say someone is saving 20k a year for 10 years with this splilt. At the end of it with 5% you're at 28k or so in bonds. Like sure, that's great, but what does this accomplish? Is it intended to be more like a rainy-day fund? It seems trivial in the grand scheme of retirement. Maybe I just have a gambler mindset lol.",

        "summarized_comments": " The theory behind asset allocation is that if you're targeting 90/10, and stocks start to rip, you will naturally be selling stock to buy bonds to maintain that ratio . Plus when rates are high, zero coupon bonds are fantastic . Bonds are a place to store dry powder for correction days .  Researchers find all-in stock investing provides better value for long-run accumulation of wealth . The article says bond allocation usually compares unfavorably to simply being all in on stocks . I am 100% equities early in my career but would not do this if I were 60 years old and planning to retire soon .  The best pension funds, endowment funds, etc manage their assets using this style of diversification and rebalancing . Using a market downturn as a trigger for your belief that the market is on the verge of an upswing is *absolutely* timing the market, and absolutely* a bullshit strategy .  An argument for having bonds in a young, risk-tolerant investor\u2019s portfolio is probably the best argument . The argument always amuses me. I have far more control buying bonds from the market than buying stocks .  In 2020 I did take charge and sell bonds and bought some stock which made me a 40% return on those investment . The only real purpose for bond is something to just keep up with inflation . You can do this with CD's, treasuries and other 'cash' type assets .  A 50% market drop means you still lose 45% of value with a 90/10 portfolio . Gaining 8% over 30 years is better than 10% for 10 years then getting scared and never investing again .  OP stated he could not think about a scenario where it made sense while everyone over 50 remembers how much money they lost in the 2008 crash . Many people had to sell at a 50% loss due to losing their jobs and lack of liquidity . Having some spare cash in a case of a market downturn is valuable .  The idea is to have an investment that earns some lower amount of interest but is still highly liquid . If rates are low and raises are scheduled then HYSA is more appropriate depending on where rates are .  For the young, a high quality bond fund could help when the stock market crashes . Approximately 10% is a good round number to eyeball . Treasuries offer a tax advantage and similar returns to other bonds or HYSAs . The best time to buy a house is when you need one and can afford it .  Using this calculator with 11% risk-on, 4.5 risk-off, 15% stddev (one year returns) gives a sharpe ratio of .4, strongly favoring the bonds . The real purpose of bonds is provides a buffer for volatility .  The only exception is a short term T-bill ETF like BIL . I wouldn't touch non-expiring bond ETFs with a ten foot pole . The idea is that you preserve your capital more and more as time goes by .  Retired people generally don't have income so they can't weather stock market volatility without selling more of the their stocks at lower prices . The median boomer net worth is only $207k and a lot of that is in their homes, if they own one .  Young investors have such a long time horizon that bonds don\u2019t belong in their portfolio . Bonds act like a shock absorber for people who get nervous when the market drops . You can lock in a good interest rate and increase the value of the bond .  For young investors, dollar cost average into a low-cost fund indexed to the S&amp;P500 . In 35 years, you'll have a couple million bucks .  The closer a crash is to your retirement the more likely you are to run out of money if you don\u2019t have a safety net for downside risk . If you are just buy and hold forever, and can stick to it, you probably don't want bonds .  The importance of always having bonds in your portfolio is the experience it builds through the years by holding it . The important part is to live frugally, so you are always adding to your savings .  Long term bonds are cheaper than they've been in many years and with the fed about to cut rates they're likely to appreciate in value in addition to guaranteed interest payments . Long-dated treasuries are a good place to store your dry powder for now .  At 35, I'm 100% focused on the best total return for the long term . I have 100% of my HSA in VTIAX because I'm not touching those funds for 30 years or more . I do not just invest in bonds and crypto, I do invest in businesses .  Fixed income is about timing so you get a low risk cash flow that compounds at rate of return that is close to the average market return . Treasuries are also a great place to pile cash with tax advantages and use the equity to cover option margin requirements .  The only reason I can think of is having it as dry powder to deploy during corrections and bear markets . The only other reason is if it\u2019s in a brokerage account and you\u2019re expecting an expense coming up in the next year .",

        "summarized_comments": " VOO and VTI are 99% correlated. The difference in performance is a rounding error . VOO/VTI and VT is an entirely different allocation. VT is a long hand that wins or you're playing casino rules .  After 30 years of maxing it out it\u2019s only about 10% of the portfolio . Biggest mistake was keeping the Roth in a balanced fund with a lot of bonds .  The S&amp;P 500 index is diversified by revenues and has a global exposure on that basis . But it is still an equity product. It can still be prone to large and regular drawdowns . Bear markets occur every 2/3 years, corrections almost annually . But on a long enough timescale it is \"almost\" impossible to lose money .  The biggest issue is when amateurs \"diversify\" they tend to buy the largest positions in the S&amp;P500 -- often tech or blue chip companies . The issue is that isn't diversification. It is often buying stocks that are well correlated with the index .  The \"it-could-never-happen-to-us\" scenario that gets dismissed by all of the \"experts\" on this forum is if you were living in Japan and invested in the the the Nikkei in 1989, you could continue to DCA until 2009 with absolutely no positive return on any of the money as it took 20 years to bottom . You don't grow your money as fast with diversification but over a long horizon you do mitigate risk and some of the ups and downs .  Certain sectors of the market like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare all have fairly low correlation with markets in general, but again, they underperform the S&amp;P 500 as well . It is possible to beat the market, but it requires more risk and with that more volatility .  Investors pay almost 5x the fees holding SPY over SPLG . Every 7 years there was a recession sometimes occurring within 1 year after last one . S&amp;P 500 index if held over 25 years one can avoid murder from major corrections caused by recessions .  If you only hold S&amp;P500 but want to expand into mid caps for the upside growth, I would suggest adding ETF ticker XMMO . If your question is about protecting against potential for extended market down-turn, then consider adding \"defensive\" holdings .  Back in the mid 70's, the S&amp;P was around 90, today it's around 5600 . Warren Buffett wants his eventual executor to keep his estate 90% invested in S.P 500 index funds . The difference in return is so small, seems like only upside to get the bonus diversity .  Many people focus on buying lots of stocks to diversify when you can just own shares in 1 or 2 funds and then simply focus on the core stocks . The S&amp;P500 index fund is already diversified, it's literally 500 companies .  Most professional investors advise a \"buy low, sell high,\" strategy . For long term investors, volatility doesn\u2019t matter. As for capital wipeout, it\u2019s very unlikely for index trackers . I'd love to hear what professional traders think .  Theres a bigger context than buy&amp;forget; forget . I manage my portfolio. I dont want to get stuck in 20y range. I would suggest a mix of mgk, moat, sgol, itb, usl etc.",

In the case of big tech they need a large amount of capital available at all times just to cover payroll and to fund accounts that a large business has . Then toss on top of that always have money sitting around for potentially buying smaller companies .  You can still learn a lot from these differences, but there are limits . You need to learn why people do what they do and when you see something that is helpful to you apply it to your situation, but don't blindly imitate .  Options trading is a viable way to improve expected returns but it\u2019s not for the uninformed . I would say having a large cash allocation in your investing portfolio for the average investor is suboptimal .  Most people with serious long term investing goals have cash as part of a percentage portfolio and they rebalance after a set period of time . This is sort of buying the \"dip\" because you deploy cash into equities if they dip below the chosen percentage allocation .  The general trend of the market is up, and therefore today's all time high will become the low of the next dip . So It's safer to be invested all of the time . I have $250K in VTI, and $250k in equivalent cash waiting to go into VTI (ups and downs as they come)  In other countries I've lived in the lowest ever was 1% when rates were \"rock bottom\" Post 2008/9 i don't think I've seen under 2/2.5% for a standard savings account . The rates are only higher in countries with less stable currencies .  The author says his investment strategy is based on what he needs to have for a large down payment on a house . He bought some TLT to play with that as inflation continues to fly high and rates stay high, it\u2019ll be good for the yield .  How didn't people learn after watching so many get burned by the covid bull run? So many people pulled money out absolutely convinced we were hitting a recession, only to watch their potential gains fly by .  The world can go to hell while I float and sip on my margarine, says ROTH . Buy stocks when the markets down and buy bonds when they're high then sell to buy stock when low . Buy more VTI like always and keep a 6 month cash reserve for emergencies .  The author has a long term proven strategy already that has already made much more than worrying about a .25% drop would ever bother to make a single dent in . You sound like the perfect candidate for buy and  hold. Don't be so focused on the tree you miss the forest you miss .  Buy a Vaca house instead of a bank account . Buy more than $100,000 worth of cash . Buy some of the cash in the bank .  The Fed basically said \"if the data stays as is, we will cut in September\" last meeting and so far data is staying in line with what we've been having . Cutting rates isn\u2019t good. Simply means, FEDs are cutting rates so people can afford more .",

        "summarized_comments": " You can max your 401k early and spread the remaining amount over the last few pay periods . If you over contribute and have to stop your contribution during the year, your company may do a true up .  If you max out early so your contributions stop, some employers will stop employer contributions then as well . Some companies only set up their system to match when they see a contribution coming out of your paycheck . Others have true up, where they will still make the match if they know you have maxed out your contribution for the year .  With your 401k it doesn't really pay to go beyond your match unless you already have the emergency fund, no plans for a remodel, a late model HVAC system in the house, etc. If you qualify for a HSA, then maybe even use that money to max it out too . If you can afford to save at least 15% of your salary + any company match in 401k, then do that .  You can't max out someone else's 401K and enjoy that person's tax benefits . Your goal should always be to max out 401k contributions . A 401k has soo many protections against excessive taxation, lawsuits, divorce .  The last 3 paychecks of the year tend to be hefty because I've maxed out, and that helps with my Roth IRA contribution early the following year . In theory, maxing out early yields slightly better returns, but it's a PITA for cashflow, not worth it .  You can't withdraw (without penalty) money before 59.5 yrs old . Make sure you have a bunch in taxable investment account to use between ages 45-59.5, or beginning whenever you want to retire early .  For emergency funds get a HYSA with rate if returns between 3-5% . For long term wealth building get a tax exempt account out of the market and max fund that\u2026any of your gains are tax free!

        "selftext": "Hey All,\n\nUnsure if this is allowed, but wanted to caution people against investing with Groundfloor. \n\nQuick back story...\n\nI invested a large sum on Groundfloor ($300K+), distributed across 100+ notes in 2022. They were intended to be short term investments, with maturities coming up in the next 1-2 months. Three months later, almost nothing was paid out - which is fine, I get there were weird things happening in the economy, but rates were still low. \n\nI asked what was happening with the notes since they all still said they were current. They said they granted the owners a one-time extension for 90 days due to COVID. They said \"good news is you have almost no notes in default!\" To which I said yeah, I'd have like 90% in default but you gave everyone an extension. They assured me it was the best course to recover the capital in a timely fashion and that supply issues were just delaying remodels a bit. \n\nThree months later, more extensions - even though they said it was a one-time extension. Two years later and I have notes that matured as far back as January 2022. They didn't start foreclosures for over a year, while the fed kept hiking rates, and I kept raising hell. They kept brushing me off. \n\nMy \"return\" right now is 5.5%, but it ignores the almost $100K in defaulted loans I hold, some of which now have notes like \"foreclosures in this state can take 12-18 months and the process has started.\"\n\nCompany is a fucking joke. Their statistics are crazy misleading and they manipulate them to paint a much rosier picture than reality. I've also asked for history of my support messages to address their \"one-time\" claim and they say they don't keep history for accounts that far back. Kind of hoping someone more motivated than me sues them into oblivion. \n\nI'll be fine in the end but an expensive lesson I figured I'd pass on to try to save someone else the pain. \n\nFuck Groundfloor.  \n\nEDIT: Someone pointed out a good thing to clarify - I invested in their LRO's, not their notes. I suspect the notes are fine. ",

I've been investing in their automated platform (you don't pick the individual LROs) for 8 months or so and have liked it so far .  Gamestop simply traded so much that the stock clearinghouse that Robinhood used issued a margin call to Robinhood for more than the cash they had .

Doing a little research, there is little indication that the price will go up to what I paid for them due to either buying at an unusual price spike or changes in company management/performance.\n\nGiven the trend of negative growth the past 4 years, would you take out this $177 and re-invest it, or wait and see if by some miracle they start to go back up to capture at least some of what I paid for them.\n\nTIA for any and all advice!",

You can write off $3000 per year of any income . Doesn't have to be capital gains, you can carry anything more to next year and write off more income .  This mentality, while natural, of waiting to get even is a combo of loss aversion, wishful thinking, and lost opportunity cost . Most large &amp; important companies will not lose 90% of its value - that means they're sliding into obscurity - like Kodak .  You held the stocks since 2020, spce and atomera both spiked twice, once in 2021 and once in 2022 . Your average price on atomera is about 17.86, assuming it's the one with the 87% loss, its price was above that price .  You have about $3,500 in losses, and those three stocks, then invest the proceeds into something different than what it was in . The answer is to tax loss harvest and learn to diversify when investing in high risk companies .  It's called tax loss harvesting and will let you avoid about $525 in capital gains taxes . If it's in an IRA, you can sell them, or keep them around as a reminder to not be such an idiot next time :-D  If marijuana ever becomes federally legal, maps could increase, map could increase .

Oren: When is someone going to create a chatbot that can give honest answers to financial questions without the bias that a human will have?  Past performance doesn't predict future results, and the S&amp;P 500 could easily underperform in the future . But, there is this thing called being prudent. And most people think they can stomach the downside and in reality they cannot .  Fisher significantly beat the market for 2023 for a family member\u2019s IRA . 47.3% after fees . That is double what I got in 2023 . The taxable account was 30.19%, so not much better than VTI .  No semi-competent business would ever make such a dumb rule and if they did it would have so much overly complicated wording and rules that it wouldn\u2019t need to follow through . Nobody offers this guarantee because it\u2019s impossible. It would encourage excess risk taking .  Fisher does care about clients, primarily in the form of pre enting money . They talk many clients off the ledge when the market crashes . They will not beat the market in good years but they're good at minimizing losses during bad years, that's their strength .  The fee is really high so I do have the thought of pulling out and doing it on my own at some point . Not all FAs are the same -- some are great at tax efficiency, others great at wealth preservation, and some are actually good at investing .  It's actually against the law for a FA to charge based on performance (or give performance refunds) unless you're in a hedge fund or other \"qualified or accredited\" umbrella . No FA should ever claim or guarantee any kind of returns, except with instruments like annuities or perpetuities, but those will be way under market .  The 1.25% fee is high, it is a lot, but keep in mind they take the fees quarterly so it's .315% / quarter . The market has performed well over the last year and a half so hard to say if long term it is the best option .  Fisher is known in the industry as one of the highest fee brokers around . Their marketing is good, but their marketing might as well just sell monthly covered call call calls .  Fisher advertising is the pretty front end but what is really behind that . 91% of financial advisors fail to beat the market over a 10 year period .  Fisher Investments charges 1% AUM . You\u2019ll pay a load in fees and very likely will not beat the low cost index funds you already own .  Most people are woefully under invested in equities . Equities should be a major component of your portfolio up until 10 years from your projection date of death . Fisher will guide you on how to allocate your money within stocks and bonds .",

I've gone over the basics with her like what shares are, and what they actually mean.  I've talked about dividends and yields and all those things.  We are to the point where I would like her to have some real world experience.\n\nI've decided that the way I would like this to work is to \"give\" each of them an investing account.  I have three accounts with Fidelity, each named after each of them.  Technically they are all in my name because I want to retain the account as mine own (for tax purposes).  In each account I placed $100.  They all get to do this when they hit 11 years old.\n\nSo now here we are with the first daughter reaching 11 and I'm finding it rather hard to watch her decide what to invest in.  Basically she has chosen two companies, Coca-cola and Ford.  She like the drink and her uncle works at Ford.  That's her reasoning right now.  She isn't sure how much she would like to do for each and I'm not sure how to guide her.  Currently her plan is to take the $100 and just split it.  Is there a better way to teach that?\n\nAlso, I'm just struggling to let her make these choices.  I know the two companies she chose are solid companies.  They may not make her tons of money but they aren't going to go belly up either, it's just really hard.  Does this method of teaching seem to be a good method?  \n\nThanks for any advice.\n\nEdit: \nHere is what I've already changed based on comments: \n1. She will get to pick stocks for half the money.  There is some allure to this get rich quick idea and I would like to hopefully pop this idea. \n2. The other half will go into voo after an explanation of what an ETF is (she already has a good grasp of this). \n3. We are going to create a spreadsheet and teach the two portfolio's and see what \"wins\".",

The only thing you can do is let them invest themselves to make sense of the market on their own terms . My son found vix on his own and trades it quite profitable .  The Investopedia game is playing with a 13-year-old girl and her husband . The next big lesson is when to sell a stock based on fundamentals . The accounts are legally completely theirs at adulthood .  Every dollar he puts in I\u2019ll match 100% of his money, which he\u2019s already learning he doesn\u2019t want to be in debt . The first time we went on vacation with that system, they had to decide to spend their own money .  You want to instill the idea that picking stocks is hard and random . Over time you should evaluate with her how these stocks perform during market upwards trends, crashes, and bubbles and discuss why they may be performing a certain way .  Parents who encourage kids to save more by offering artificially high interest rates are just misleading their kids . Fidelity has actual youth accounts available when they turn 13, you should look into that .  At her age the key is to teach the power of compounding, says author . She will learn to invest/save once she learns the value of money...  You rock. I feel like all kids need to be taught the basics from a young age . Ford is a terrible company and absolutely can go to zero, but perhaps a bit more information should be given .",

Is there a legit reason to start buying 5 gram slivers of gold as opposed to holding bonds or a HYSA? Legit question, no snark on my part. I really am just curious. ",

        "summarized_comments": " Most people who buy physical gold also believe in conspiracy theories about hyper inflation or how the USA is going to collapse . However gold can be an uncorrelated asset to stocks and bonds and in portfolio construction having uncorreliant assets can add stability .  The base premise was the US government no longer functioned and USD was worthless . The problem with using gold when society collapses is the fact that it collapsed . Food, water, bullets, medical supplies, etc. might have some trade value again, but not anytime soon after the collapse .  A pocket of gold coins or spread out among family members is a good piece of security for everyone . You can exchange them for a local currency with little to no losses in any country at any bank, or pay with them directly .  Gold has always \"held it's value\" because it can be used as a form of wealth during the rebuilding phase . It's completely useless during the survival phase after a societal collapse, and since society is not currently collapsed it is very unlikely I will still be alive during the next rebuilding phase where gold has value .  Many people see the risk of dollar and/or societal collapse and some believe it is inevitable . If you buy gold and disaster never comes, there\u2019s no existential threat. If disaster does come and you have no gold, it could be the difference between survival and demise of individuals and families .  Most people who buy physical gold also believe in conspiracy theories about hyper inflation or how the USA is going to collapse . A lot of times the gold push is more political than investment . Gold is a place for scared people to run to. It fits right in on their marketing plan of scaring people into what they label as a safe investment .  Gold has no value because...it will rapidly become too valuable for the US to let citizens hold...again . Gold produces no cash flow nor productivity growth, and in fact you have to pay to store it .  Physical gold is for if you want a hard asset with no counter party risk that you'll hold for 30+ years as a safety net . Gold people are always looking for ways to store wealth outside of others' control . There are periods where gold has very low correlation to equities .  Where does one go to offload their small fortune of Valcambi gold bars where they won't take a bath on it? \"Gold price is standardized in Taiwan fyi, you aren\u2019t even allowed to buy or sell gold below or above 2% spread to protect consumers.\u00a0 So you could just sell to the government. For US, your best bet is coin shops or online retailers .  Gold is a good short term leverage investment if you understand how futures work and have a basic grasp of trend following . It's a finite rare resource. It\u2019s a reasonable go-to if you\u2019re diversifying against fiat currency .  Gold is at an all time high right now and the market is about to go into correction-mode (possibly recession) I'd hold off because it's doing well, which makes you interested in investing in it . Gold is fine, but if you need it as currency, then there are bigger problems you need to deal with .  Gold (not silver) tends to keep pace with inflation or slightly exceed it . Gold is a store of wealth in an inflationary environment but a terrible investment . Gold isn't an investment in the way many people view the term .  As an investment, you can do better as a hedge against inflation, it\u2019s a good viable option . Buy some coins or bars, throw them into a safe and come back in 20-30 years . With the amount of inflation and money printing, of course people are becoming more interested in gold .  Precious metals are mainly a store of wealth that is less likely to depreciate than paper currency . Supply of newly-mined gold is much less than the supply of paper money . Gold performance is just cap gains when you sell .  The idea is to buy it and not use it until society collapses back into sort of stoneage bartering society . Gold and silver is also a nice way to store money that isn\u2019t being tracked .  It's not really any less volatile than the stock market, but there is some value in it being uncorrelated with the two most common classes of assets, stocks and bonds . Gold is universally accepted, and is not dependent on the stability of any country . In a war time scenario, you can barter with it . In WW2, the US government even issued [barter kits] with gold coins for troops caught behind enemy lines .  Gold should always be part of the tool kit if it\u2019s a concern you have . Bitcoin could be sponges for liquidity should it decide to move . Central banks are favoring gold over sovereign bonds .  The fixed costs of buying and possessing the yellow metal is too high \u2014 it is not so much for investing as hedging against societal collapse . Since 1971, gold has returned just under 8% a year, but its main value in portfolio construction is its lack of correlation with stocks and bonds .",

The HYSAs in the 4s% are safe for a little, but as the fed cuts rates eventually depending on how much how fast the Fed cuts rates the banks will lower their rates .  Credit card rates are actually pegged to the the prime rate . Mortgage interest rates will also drop (people can refinance if they're on a high interest mortgage), housing prices will increase because there will be more demand .  Starting next month interest rates on HYSAs, Corporate Bonds, Treasuries and Money Market Funds will go down and inflation will go up . As interest rates lower the price of bonds (which were purchased at the previous higher interest rate) will increase in value .  The most recent Fed projections showed the median expectation for rates as end-2024 @ 5.125%, end- 2025 @ 4.125% and end-26 @ 3.125%.
