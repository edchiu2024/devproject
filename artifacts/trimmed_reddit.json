        "selftext": "Alright folks, mega caps and AI are all the rave but there's plenty of rather unknown companies which are growing their earning's at a tremendous rate. My portfolio in 2022 was Costco, Nvidia, Apple, Google and MSFT. They all did beautifully but they're too big for my liking now. Here's the speculative crap I'm investing in now\n\n**1. GigaCloud Technology** \\- Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth. Already up a lot on this company and earning's coming up Q4 which expecting big beat.\n\n**2.** **Vita-Coco** \\- Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives.\n\n**3. Braze** \\- Companies need a way to stay in touch with their customers, Braze creates a subscription model which handles all types of communication with customers and automates the process. This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company.\n\n**4. Draft Kings** \\- California and Texas still have not legalized online gambling which those two states alone are absolutely massive. Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing.\n\n**5.** **Sofi -** The numbers don't lie. When rate cuts were plausibly announced we saw a massive jump. This company wants to run when rate cuts come but until then ppl really weary even though the numbers and guidance are phenomenal.\n\n**6. Palantir** \\- S&amp;P500 inclusion didn't come after 5 quarters now of GAAP profitability, so in June imo we'll see it happen which is a huge catalyst. The earning's are growing as a we all know. I don't like the P/E ratio but this is a company I'd buy and immediately sell CC's on and keep selling CC\"s until reaching my assigned price and repeating while holding long term.\n\nEveryone of these companies imo has strong growing earning's, relatively unknown still compared to what everyone's piling into, and most have major catalysts coming up. COCO has summer, DK has legalization of massive states, Sofi has pending rate cuts, Palantir has sp500 inclusion, at least Braze and Giga about to report and beat as they do Q4 which should act as minor catalysts imo.",

        "summarized_comments": " GigaCloud has already run up 700% over the year and still looks reasonably priced . Gigacloud and COCO personally have peaked my interest (again already have a position in SOFI)  There's so much frothiness, I haven't seen rabies among investors foaming at the mouth with greed and crazy gains everywhere since 2021 . The balance sheet and the income statement are about as good as it gets, for a stock with a sub $30 pe ratio, and sub $50 stock price .  The Dow was the first to hit ATH since the 2022 bear market since the 2012 bear market . I kind of doubt it's going to compensate if the Nasdaq happens to dip, and really, the Dow is foreshadowing a dip . I'm still holding thinking I might add more apple if it continues downward .  The market may not tank on Powell's speech, seems like a really good excuse to do-so though and have algo's buy back shaking out many . I think ppl are investing in these companies because \"*too big to fail*\", I'm weary thinking I'll go more isolated unknown growth stories .  \"Our Marketplace enjoys an extensive range of over 30,000 SKUs\" \"GCT just got back to zero. Interesting pic. Seems tiny, not even big enough for one industry industry industry,\" says Samsara .  These are probably a really good stock it's just outside my wheel house. These all plunged today for some reason. These are unknown? It\u2019s all over wsb for years. The business model seems robust. If you think Unity is going to do well in the future? No. wait for the next bus, don't jump into the kidnapper van .  I'm sorry if I was off here and you didn't actually use AI to write this post . I've been making numbered lists now for years on Reddit before ChatGPT was even around lol talking about investments I like and am buying .",

        "summarized_comments": " Disney is currently up 36% in 6 months . Disney+ account for a larger segment of its revenue like it was predicted years ago, but so far they are doing an ok job in a pretty saturated market .  Disney+ still have 150 million subs, little more than half of Netflix . They lost **$1.5 billion** last year on streaming . They strangled their best film IP to death . Despite all their amazing IP, they still can't turn a profit on D+ .  ESPN+ will continue to buy TV rights to stream sports, and will become more and more commonplace as the general public moves away from cable/satellite TV . Average sports fans and gamblers alike will be forced to buy subscription whether they like it or not . The positive is it's the only profitable streaming service, Hulu and Disney+ continue to lose money .  Disney has really poor execution in eCommerce and gaming at their scale . There\u2019s no direct link between intent (streaming content) and spend (understanding user preferences and translating this into high-margin income streams, merchandising, and theme parks revenue)  Disney feels like a modern zombie . Lots of strong IPs, tons of former loyal customers and street cred that is now actively squandered . Netflix, YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and countless others had stolen all kids/youths interest .  The market may be forward looking but not that much forward . The market is not forward looking, it's forward-looking. The market isn't so forward looking. It's forward looking .",

        "selftext": "How does the S&amp;P500 Keep such a postive return rate? I know the long-term average return is 10%. Last year it was much higher, but and the market is at an all time high if I'm not mistaken. My question is how is the S&amp;P500 able to keep such returns? I know they swap out company stocks when they don't so great, but surely that should even out, right? Nothing can climb forever.\n\nI understand DCA in theory SHOULD average out over say a decade (you'll get some highs and some lows), but if the market is at an all time high, why should I keep investing in it now? I know no one has a crystal ball and it could keep going even higher and I'm losing out money as well, but the market MUST have a ceiling, right?\n\nI was DCA'ing weekly into an S&amp;P500 ETF and have gotten a healthy return, but I can't see how it can will keep climbing, so I've halted investing into that and am starting into Treasury stocks which will have a significantly less return, but should be safer (in theory).\n\nCan someone explain how the S&amp;P500 keeps climbing? And how it can have such a positive return on average? Thank you!",

        "summarized_comments": " The S&amp;P 500 dumps losers and adds winners. It\u2019s essentially the infinite money glitch. It's also a self-fulfilling prophecy, in that when a new ticker gets added to the index it invariably turns into a 'winner'  The S&amp;P 500 is a measure of the value humans are producing, and it makes sense that with our 5G Internet, AI, and computers and robots helping us work at light speed, this is worth exponentially more than a few decades ago . The market reflects all publicly traded companies in an economy .  The market spends significantly more time going up than it spends going down . It is statistically speaking, one of the most bullish indicators for an index . The question is will other companies start to perform better to raise the index .  Historically, the stock market does much better under Democrats, according to CFRA Research . Since 1945, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged an annual gain of 11.2% during years when Democrats controlled the White House . That's well ahead of the 6.9% average gain under Republicans .  Wikipedia article: \"Reasons for Over-Performances by Democratic Presidents\" Blinder and Watson studied the comparative economic performance from Truman's elected term through Obama's first term in 2012 . Democrats did benefit from lower oil prices, larger increases in productivity, and better global conditions .  The risk of never returning to valuation this cheap can be bigger than risk of pullback tomorrow . I swear this sub is terrible. All the top answers suck except for this one you're replying to . The shares will go up and down in value but there's no reason why a profit this year needs to be balanced by a loss some other year .  The economy is not a zero sum game . Companies are valued based on the future cash flow they generate . The SPY is not an index of 500 fixed companies . If one company fails to remain profitable it simply gets replaced not the index .  The price of things tends to go up 2-3% a year, generally more than that for technology related items . Things now cost 4x to 5x what they did in the 1960s . The better questions are around how to discern which companies are best at compounding their progress vs others .  The S&amp;P 500 has had hundreds and hundreds of \"all-time-highs\" over time . An all-time high means nothing and should have no bearing on your long-term investment strategy . The notion that the market is rational or efficient is ridiculous .  Do you think timing the market is a good idea with a high likelihood of success over the long-term? The market could go down, or trade sideways, or go up over the short term . The problem is even if you time the market out there's very interesting to distichs with that if you missed just the 10 biggest day gains over the last six decades, you would've missed 70% of the market returns .  Historically, a high PE ratio would indicate the market expects a lot of growth, but the last 15 years have been driven by low cost of equity . If the Fed were to get back, and stay, at historic norms, the stock market might crash . This is why financial media and Wall Street keep talking about rate cuts despite low unemployment and inflation slightly above the Fed's 2% target .  As long as the Fed keeps printing money and the Treasury spends it, certain stocks (I did say certain) will benefit from said spending . Defense stocks, Tech stocks, certain Pharma stocks, etc. ESG stocks are probably not a good bet right now . Capitalism works well for those with capitol . Everyday millions of America go to work, get screwed on their labor, and the owners profit .  The market itself climbs forever (of course there are occasional setbacks, but it climbs much more than falls) Long term it always goes up because the sp500 adjusts to whatever the current largest market cap companies are . The question is will it keep growing at a rate of 10% in the future?  The idea of DCA is to continually invest in the market . Companies make more than people thought they were going to, so their prices go up to match the valuation . The federal government is dumping trillions into the economy and this money finds its way into the market. The US got rid of pensions in favor of 401k retirement plans. The entire retirement system is constantly plowing money into passive S&amp;P500 passive funds. The more skeptics there are, the more the market rises .  The stock market has gone up roughly at the same pace of the added money supply . The value created by publicly traded companies is expected to grow for many reasons, but one major reason is population growth . The index only keeps the best 500 companies .  When GDP contracts stock valuations will contract and stocks will go down . It\u2019s inevitable at some point but who knows when and for what reasons . The S&amp;P is just a rotating snapshot of the largest companies in the market .  The economy has increased continuously with the advent of new technology since the beginning of time . Human productivity simply keeps increasing and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future . It has to keep increasing because certain individuals/institutions can take a loan against it/sell it in exchange for goods .",

        "selftext": "Sales of Apple's iPhone plunged in China in the first six weeks of 2024, according to a Counterpoint Research report.\n\nThe analyst firm said in a note on Tuesday that iPhone sales plunged 24% in the period, as Apple faced stiff competition from local smartphone firms like Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi.\n\nApple shares were down over 2% in U.S. premarket trading.\n\nApple came under particular pressure from Chinese tech giant Huawei, whose consumer business is experiencing a resurgence in China after the launch of its Mate 60 smartphone.\n\nSeveral rival Chinese smartphone companies also logged drops in their unit sales in the six-week period, but the declines were less pronounced than that of Apple.\n\nOppo's smartphone shipments dropped 29% year-on-year, while Vivo and Xiaomi logged drops of 15% and 7%, respectively, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nThe best-performing smartphone brands for the first six weeks were Huawei and its spinoff Honor, which branched out of the tech giant in 2020 as a result of U.S. sanctions.\n\n\nHuawei smartphone unit shipments rose 64% year-over-year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research. Shipments of Honor handsets, meanwhile, added 2%.\n\nApple is facing a tough environment in its key market, China. Several notable trends are adding pressure, not least of which is intense competition from local Chinese smartphone makers \u2014 including a resurging Huawei.\n\nLast year, Huawei launched a smartphone called the Mate 60, which had 5G connectivity. That was a major surprise to the world, as the U.S. government hit Huawei with numerous sanctions in 2019 and 2020, cutting it off from key chips and technology required for 5G mobile internet.\n\nOnce the world's largest smartphone player by sale volumes, Huawei was really the only major challenger to Apple in China when it came to high-end devices. Customers flocked to iPhones, once Huawei's phones lost their competitiveness due to the lack of 5G and no cutting-edge semiconductors.\n\nHuawei is seeing the early signs of a revival with the Mate 60.\n\n\"Huawei is making a come back trying to win back the defectors to iPhone from a couple of years ago,\" Neil Shah, analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\n\n\"There is some erosion for Apple but more so it's other non-Apple brands in the premium segment also feeling the heat from Huawei.\"\n\n\"Apple also had abnormally higher \"sell-through\" in January 2023 vs. 2024 as the supply shifted to January after the China factory debacle in the fourth quarter of 2022,\" Shah added.\n\nApple's supply chain experienced major disruptions in late 2022 due to Covid-19 lockdowns in China.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/03/05/apple-iphone-sales-plunge-24percent-in-china-as-huawei-resurges-report-says.html",

If you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those communities instead without linking back here .  Apple has the highest likelihood of being dropped in the future with Microsoft having the lowest chance . The M series chip alone is a more impactful innovation than anything Google has come up with in the same time frame . The company is objectively doing nothing but coasting for the last half decade .  There is a reason why Apple is worth more than google because Warren has more side projects in the mix that can potentially send their stock higher . Apple has proven they can enter or create a new industry with a new product/service and maintain steady growth .  Apple was late to the party multiple times in this past decade when i comes to innovative new things and yet when they finally release whatever they have been working on it catches up to all competitors . Some, including chartist Carter Worth, have been predicting a pullback in AAPL to $150-160 since it \"failed\" at the $200 level .  The only reason I\u2019m considering selling my Apple stock is to reduce my non-index fund investments . Iphones, airpods and apple watches are immensely popular, but in case you're not I live in China, and have seen plenty of counterfeit iPhones .  Apple is dead for now as nothing life changing is in their portfolio\u2026 and as soon as the corpo world and leaders will get it that only peace and wealth can create demand .

But I'm not saying there definitely won't be a crash, but in the now cliche but true words of Peter Lynch, Far more money has been lost by investors in preparing for corrections, or anticipating corrections, than has . been lost in the corrections themselves .  It's the longest climb since 1964, when the market suffered a huge fall following the worst pandemic since 1917 . It\u2019s just that the 35% rise came after a 57% crash . The steepest run is 58% steeper .  The number of people talking like they're AI experts and are completely sure AI will change the way they work in the short term makes me concerned . It\u2019s AI mania still but that hype will run out eventually, mabye soon . The bigger issue I see is competitors like AMD stepping in and making the market more competitive .  We won\u2019t have a consumerism economy anymore, we\u2019ll have to re-invent the whole economy . Companies that do not employ AGI will go out of business, goods/services will get cheaper . Those who do will wage a price wars, ever decreasing the prices of goods and simultaneously increasing their margins .  Some people will still have a job (hello, worlds oldest profession!). As unemployment rises, government will be forced to find a solution . Central banks will have a hard time fighting deflation . Even if AGI happens tomorrow, this will take decades .  People think the soft landing is guaranteed, but the Fed still needs to cut rates early enough before it gets too restrictive and tip the economy into a recession . The Fed already made the mistake of letting inflation get out of control and lose their credibility . They can absolutely cut pre-emptively even if growth is not weak .  Following a monster year like 2023, it's likely we'll have a correction with magnitudes around 15% . This is not at all true, I did the math on S&amp;P returns in years following a year with a 20% or more return .  April is the best month of the year, but you\u2019re talking October through April, not these three months . I\u2019m nervous there will be a correction so to speak, but the markets have had some catching up to to do from being suppressed by inflation and high interest rates . I'm 90% long on equities and 10% cash .  The market is heavily underestimating inflation, says Zweig . When they are as overextended as now it doesn't take much for a sharp correction, he says . He says no major correction is coming unless US government fails to pay said debt .  Market recovers 100% of the time historically\u2026 so why would we be nervous? I'm not worried in the slightest we have yet to see the real pump to 8,500+ .",

That followed a two-notch cut from Moody\u2019s in early February.*\n\n*The downgrade could trigger contractual obligations from counterparties of NYCB that require the bank to maintain an investment grade deposit rating, according to analysts who track the company. (Consumer deposits at FDIC-insured banks are covered up to $250,000.)*\n\n*NYCB finds itself in a stock freefall that began a month ago when it reported a surprise fourth-quarter loss and steeper provisions for loan losses. Concerns intensified last week after the bank\u2019s new management found \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in the way it reviewed its commercial loans. Shares of the bank have fallen 72% this year, including an 19% decline Monday, and now trade hands for less than $3 apiece.*\n\n*Of key interest for analysts and investors is the status of NYCB\u2019s deposits. Last month, the bank said it had $83 billion in deposits as of Feb. 5, and that 72% of those were insured or collateralized. But the figures are from the day before Moody\u2019s began slashing the bank\u2019s ratings, sparking speculation about possible flight of deposits since then.*\n\n*The Moody\u2019s ratings cuts could impact funds in at least two areas: a \u201cBanking as a Service\u201d business with $7.8 billion in deposits as of a May regulatory filing, and a mortgage escrow unit with between $6 billion to $8 billion in deposits.*\n\n*\u201cThere is potential risk to servicing deposits in the event of a downgrade,\u201d Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said in Feb. 4 research note. NYCB executives told Horowitz that the deposit rating, which Moody\u2019s had pegged at A3 at the time, would have to fall four notches before being at risk. It has fallen six notches since that note was published.*\n\n*During a Feb. 7 conference call, NYCB CFO John Pinto confirmed that the bank\u2019s mortgage escrow business needed to maintain an investment grade status and said that deposit levels in the unit fluctuated between $6 billion and $8 billion.*\n\n*\u201cIf there\u2019s a contract with these depositors that you have to be investment grade, theoretically that would be a triggering event,\u201d KBW analyst Chris McGratty said of the Moody\u2019s downgrade.*\n\n*NYCB didn\u2019t immediately return calls or an email seeking comment.*\n\n*It couldn\u2019t be determined what the contracts force NYCB to do in the event of it breaching investment grade status, or whether downgrades from multiple ratings firms would be needed to trigger contractual provisions.*\n\n*To replace deposits, NYCB could raise brokered deposits, issue new debt or borrow from the Federal Reserve\u2019s facilities, but they would all probably come at a higher cost, McGratty said.*\n\n*\u201cThey will do whatever it takes to keep deposits in house, but as this scenario is playing out, it may become more cost prohibitive to fund the balance sheet,\u201d McGratty said.*",

        "selftext": "Target on Tuesday posted holiday-quarter revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations, but the company said it expects another year of weak sales. \n\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer\u2019s comparable sales declined for the third quarter in a row. The key metric, which includes digital sales and takes out the impact of store openings, closures and renovations, fell 4.4% in the fiscal fourth quarter. \n\nTarget doesn\u2019t anticipate sales will bounce back quickly. For the current quarter, Target said it expects comparable sales to drop by between 3% and 5% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.70 to $2.10. The company said it expects full-year 2024 comparable sales to be flat to up 2% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $8.60 to $9.60.\n\nYet Target stressed its progress after a rough stretch marked by lower discretionary spending. Store and website traffic, while still down year over year, improved for the second quarter in a row. Profits jumped as the company better managed inventory and benefited from falling supply chain, freight and e-commerce fulfillment costs. And an emphasis on lower price points resonated with shoppers. \n\nIn a news release, CEO Brian Cornell said the company\u2019s efforts \u201cchanged the momentum of our business.\u201d\n\nHe said Target will roll out new sales drivers, including a membership program, to get the company back to growth.\n\nCompany leaders will share more of their strategy at an investor meeting in New York City on Tuesday.\n\nHere\u2019s what the retailer reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.98 vs. $2.42 expected\n\nRevenue: $31.92 billion vs. $31.83 billion expected\n\nTarget\u2019s sluggish sales have reflected a pullback in discretionary spending over the past two years, especially after huge pandemic-driven gains. Its annual total revenue grew by about $31 billion \u2013 or nearly 40% \u2013 from fiscal 2019 to 2022 before sales leveled out. Target also said it took a hit in recent quarters from elevated levels of theft and the fallout from backlash to Target\u2019s merchandise collection for Pride Month.\n\nTo attract shoppers, the big-box retailer has emphasized value and more frequently bought categories, such as food and beauty. Over the holiday season, for example, Target touted a wide assortment of gifts and a holiday meal for four for under $25. \n\nLast month, it launched a new low-priced private brand called Dealworthy, with products like socks, paper towels, laundry detergent and more. Most items cost under $10.\n\nTarget\u2019s profits have suffered along with its sales. But the retailer made more money in the fourth quarter than it did a year ago, as it marked down fewer items, operated more efficiently and had more products in stock. \n\nTarget\u2019s net income for the three-month period rose by nearly 58% to $1.38 billion, or $2.98 per share, from $876 million, or $1.89 per share in the year-ago quarter. That was significantly higher than Target\u2019s forecasted range of between $1.90 and $2.60 per share.\n\nIts margins also were healthier compared with a year ago. Its fourth quarter operating income margin rate was 5.8% compared with 3.7% in the year-ago quarter, a time when Target\u2019s results took a hit as customers bought fewer higher-margin items like clothing, and more of lower-margin ones, such as food and household essentials.\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Feb. 3, Target\u2019s total revenue grew nearly 2% from $30.98 billion in the year-ago period. Those results got a boost from an additional week of sales compared to fiscal 2022.\n\nComparable sales dropped in stores and online. Comparable store sales fell 5.4% year over year. Digital sales declined 0.7% year over year, marking an improvement from the 6% drop in the third quarter.\n\nThe sequential improvement in traffic trends \u2013 from a 4.1% decline in the third quarter to a 1.7% decline in the fourth quarter \u2013 was fueled by more shoppers using curbside pickup. \n\nAs of Monday\u2019s close, Target\u2019s shares are up nearly 6% so far this year. That falls short of the approximately 8% gains of the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. Target\u2019s shares closed on Monday at $150.49, bringing the company\u2019s market value to $69.48 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/target-tgt-earnings-q4-2023.html",

It disappoints you because you expect it to perform as if it were an American company . Sometimes, things just won't go as you expect .  Only Chinese can buy BABA shares unless you're a Chinese citizen or meet some very strict criteria which there's no way the average redditor meets . Shareholder rights in china are not the same as those in non-Chinese companies .  The company trades at a 13 PE. Given the China risk, it's not worth touching it . Perhaps at a PE of 5.00, perhaps at a 5.0 P/E is 8-P/E . If it does make sense, does it make sense that BABA's earnings would nearly double in the next 12 months?  An investor who invested in BABA in early 20s panicked when Xi 'won' the election and went on a crackdown, striking fear through the markets, I panic sold . I was down about 55% or roughly 13k euro. I told myself it would be years before I'd break even. I am now a bag holder of BABA .  The majority of money in China is invested in real estate because there is nowhere else to really put their money . The Chiense people have never seen real estate go down, it has only gone up. That is because China has only been industrialized since the 70s. The companies lie and the companies lie .  General sentiment around BABA is at an all time low .

        "selftext": "Spotify stock has gone on a huge tear lately, almost quadrupling its stock price from a recent low around USD 70-75 to currently over 271. I\u2019m sure this has to do with several consecutive earnings reports in which they demonstrated that they could:\n\n1. Increase the number of subscribers and even re-accelerate growth despite their huge size\n2. Squeeze more money from subscribers and increase ARPU, despite growing quickly outside of Europe and the USA where revenue per user tends to be lower. \n\n\nWhile this is positive news and doubling premium subscribers since 2020 (while facing heavy competition) is impressive, I\u2019m struggling to see how they will ever turn this revenue into profit. \n\nThe problem is twofold:\n\n\n1. Spotify is totally beholden to major music labels which operate in an oligopolistic market. Spotify pays royalties to labels whenever a song is played, and they cannot at all afford to lose any of the labels. No one would use a music streaming service that is missing the entire catalogue of all major artists signed to one of the labels. So as Spotify gets more users, not only do they automatically have to pay more money for more plays, the labels can renegotiate and demand more money. This problem becomes apparent in their gross margins (more on that later). \n\n\n2. Spotify is the only major pure play music streaming service. Their competition is Apple Music, Google/Youtube Premium, Amazon Prime. Excluding China, these make up well over 90% of the global market, but all their competitors have far more ability to bundle their services/subscriptions and run the music streaming at loss/breakeven by increasing royalty payments. Now, Spotify holds about 30% of the global market share compared to Apple Music at 13.7%, Amazon at 13.3% and Google at 9% (according to MIDIA Research). So they are the market leader by far which has its benefits. But switching streaming providers, while not totally painless, is easy enough that I believe they would lose a lot of subscribers if they raise prices too high. \n\n\nA few numbers that seem to underline my thoughts:\n\n\nIn 2023 they raised premium prices for the first time ever(!) in the USA, to 10.99. This is the same exact price as Apple and YouTube Music (without YouTube Premium). While a good deal for customers, it shows they have no pricing power. \n\n\nTheir gross margin in the last quarter was 25.6%. Not only is this in fact lower than their gross margin right after their IPO 6 years ago (25.7%), it is a margin that doesn\u2019t seem to support their valuation of 3.6 currently. \n\n\nPremium subscriptions are their main source of revenue at 86% of total revenue. This number has not changed in over 2 years. Ad supported revenue not only has a terrible 11.6% gross margin but is not growing in a meaningful way. \n\n\nTheir other initiatives like podcasting and some hardware experiments have mostly failed. In fact they decided to release the Joe Rogan podcast on other services despite sinking several hundred millions into it. they are now trying to push audiobooks and merch sales as new profit drivers. Those are nice to have but I doubt they\u2019ll make a meaningful difference. It seems to me if you are enough of a fan of an artist to buy their merch, you will just do it on their Website. \n\n\nTheir one positive seems to be increasing free cash flow, which has roughly doubled in the past three years. They seem to be succeeding at generating some operating leverage. However with a 26% gross margin their biggest cost driver by far remains royalty payments. \n\n\nI guess the stock has some appeal as the market leader and main pure play publicly listed music streaming company, but to me it seems like a short candidate. What am I missing here?",

Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn\u2019t value the \u201cshovel\u201d correctly in this gold rush.   \nNow lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM).  \nIn order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things  \n**1). Companies have FINITE capex amount**  \n**2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money**  \n**3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow**  \nFor point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot.   \nI would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn\u2019t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping.  \nNow i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don\u2019t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don\u2019t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users.   \n**in summary,**   \n**I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD**",

At this point AI is a feature not a product and chat may be the killer app of AI but it reminds me a lot of the history of commercial email . The rate of advancement in AI today is at least 10x faster than the rate in the dotcom/Internet craze .  The capex required for those companies to take silicon in house would directly contradict point #3 at least through the medium term .

Amazon is yet to comment on the news.\n\nAccording to the investor presentation, Talen sold the site and assets of Cumulus Data for $650 million. The deal comprises $350 million at close and $300m escrowed, released upon development milestones anticipated in 2024.\r  \n\r  \n\"We are pleased today to have sold our Cumulus data center campus, unlocking significant value for Talen,\" said Talen president and CEO Mac McFarland. \"This transaction provides an attractive return on Talen's investment and vision in building Cumulus, and creates value through the sale of clean carbon-free power from our top-decile Susquehanna nuclear plant.\"\r  \n\r  \nFirst announced by DCD in July 2021, the 1,200-acre campus draws power from Talen Energy\u2019s neighboring 2.5GW nuclear power station in Luzerne County, the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES). The company broke ground in 2021 and completed the first 48MW, 300,000 square foot (28,870 sqm) hyperscale facility early last year, along with a separate cryptomine facility.\r  \n\r  \nTalen said AWS aims to develop a 960MW data center campus. The cloud company has minimum contractual power commitments that ramp up in 120MW increments over several years; AWS has a one-time option to cap commitments at 480MW. The cloud provider also has two 10-year extension options, tied to nuclear license renewals\r  \n\r  \nAs part of the deal, Talen will also supply AWS with energy via a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) from the Susquehanna site.\r  \n\r  \nCommissioned in 1983 for energy company PPL, the 2,494MW Susquehanna Steam Electric Station is one of the largest nuclear power plants in the US. Its current owner, Talen Energy, was founded in 2015 after the competitive power generation business of PPL Corporation was spun off and combined with competitive generation businesses owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings.\r  \n\r  \nTalen Energy formed Cumulus Growth in 2020 to \u2018invest in opportunities created by the convergence of digital infrastructure and power\u2019 and had two separate businesses; Cumulus Data, focused on hyperscale data centers; and Cumulus Coin, focused on digital currency mining.\r  \n\r  \nIn an ESG report from March 2021, Talen said the company was \u201cwell-positioned to capture value\u201d in areas such as data centers and digital coins, saying the two business areas could be a \u201cstable source of income outside of the traditional market.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Someone somewhere is not thriving and posting good economic news just stirs up the hornets nest of people who want to be discontent all the time.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says two major long-term issues facing the U.S. economy are sluggish productivity growth and low participation rates in the job market by prime-age workers .

There's plenty to be enthusiastic about with these companies but if the price isnt right returns will be lacklustre . For a lot of these big names, the biggest risk is really overpaying for them .

PSA: GenerousLiar1981 has fraudulently embellished that to now claim I made predictions on TGT stock price .  This small opportunity will keep coming with how the market thinks these days. You can hang onto a little cash the week or so before to buy a couple things extra. The market thinks no rate cuts means economy is super strong, higher prices = higher revenue and profits, people are spending, cash is terrible and companies are growing so stocks should go up...  if inflation cools and rate cuts do come we moon even higher... let's grind back up with cautious optimism .  Sometimes you need to zoom out a bit and get the bigger picture . Bitcoin will survive, we don\u2019t know which miners will survive . Miners reacted in the same way as alts when Bitcoin crashed .

I'll probably just slowly add to things on pullbacks .",

The retailer will continue to offer its free Target Circle loyalty program that offers special deals and sales throughout the year.\n\nTarget did not immediately say how much it would cost.\n\nThe big-box retailer is turning to the new revenue stream as it tries to boost weaker sales. Its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue reported Tuesday beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations, but its comparable sales have declined three quarters in a row.\n\nWith the move, Target is also following in the footsteps of retailers that have turned membership fees into a money maker and a sales driver. Amazon launched its Prime program in 2005, with perks like free two-day delivery and streaming of popular movies and original TV shows. It costs $139 per year or $14.99 per month, with the video membership-only option of $8.99 per month.\n\nWalmart launched its program, called Walmart+, in 2020. It costs $98 per year or $12.95 per month, with perks like free shipping, free grocery deliveries for orders of at least $35 and gas discounts.\n\nTarget is turning to its competitors\u2019 playbook for a reason: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors on the company\u2019s earnings call in February that Walmart+ members spend nearly twice as much as non-members and buy more over the course of a year.\n\nWalmart has not said how many people subscribe to Walmart+, but its CFO John David Rainey said on the earnings call that its membership continues to grow by double-digit percentages.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/target-launches-paid-membership-target-circle-360.html",

        "selftext": "Wynn is a company, much like my previous post (about Target), where it has peaked my interest. \n\nSo as to be transparent, I have 200 shares at an average price of about $105 per share. (My core position, of course, is the SPY, of which, I have been in the position since 2007 as additional transparency). \n\nSo, with the aforementioned in mind, why has Wynn peaked my interest? Here is my thought process from a fundamental perspective:\n\n1. Wynn's revenue, in FY 2023, effectively, returned to the revenue they had pre-pandemic, which is about $6.6 billion. (It was a long journey from 2019 to today, however, they have gotten back here and, based on 2023 FY numbers, and 2024 preliminary guidance, the company looks set to report, conservatively, earnings in the $7.50-$8.00 per share range across their portfolio of casinos).\n2. In taking a look at the balance sheet, the company has long-term debt of about $11.00 billion versus cash on hand of about $3.5 billion. Secondarily, the company reported FY 2023 EPS of $6.49 per share / $729,994,000.00 in net income (post tax). \n\nWith those fundamentals in mind, the company (as of this writing) sits at $99.00 (approximately) per share and, with the market being forward looking, and working off of the $7.50 per share in EPS for 2024, that would put the current PE at about 13.3 and, with the S&amp;P 500 trading at 20-21x earnings (depending on which 2024 EPS estimate you use) it is reasonable to think that a fair value PE for this company, which is growing faster than the S&amp;P earnings should, at a minimum, be priced at a fair value PE of 18-20x. \n\nFiguring that the company meets the EPS estimates in FY 2024 of $7.50, at a PE of 18, that would put fair value of the stock at $135.00 per share (which is about 36% upside from here). \n\nEssentially, my argument is, much like Targets, that 1. the company is fundamentally undervalued and 2. Working under the assumption that the economy stays strong AND China gets their act together (there are rumors of the CCP working to stimulate their economy --- take from it what you will) then that could mean even larger upside potential for Wynn's stock, across the board. \n\nThe obvious caveat is a black swan event OR an economy that slips into recession, however, I see no data, as of this writing, that would indicate those are on the horizon AND, with the Fed no longer raising rates, with cuts, perhaps, on the horizon, then that means more money in consumer pockets. \n\nSo, that leads me to this point that, in general terms, if the market is going to be broadening out, which it appears to be doing then, my belief is that Wynn starts to trend upwards and, in my view, over the next 3-6 months, I think it is reasonable to expect at least a 10% return from here with a best case scenario being similar to that of Target (at least in the pre-market) where the stock reports a solid quarter, is seemingly getting their act together and outperforms. \n\nCurious to get the communities feedback on this one as, to my eye, it seems like a quality investment at a reasonable price.",

And now I've already paid all my debt off last week, and sitting on $330k now (it peaked briefly at 370k like 20-30 minutes ago)  Some thought I was too late to get in on Nvidia 2 years ago . Most of my portfolio is shares . I really don\u2019t gamble on options as much but mostly because I don't know how to get out of them to make money .  \"Bitcoin and some meme coins are printing money right now. Just ride the wave. Just be a winner,\" says Reddit user . \"I'm working with a couple of hundred that I keep using and selling for small gains\" I lost 5k the last two days. Have about $2600 left, wondering where to \"invest\"  Gartner IT Conference last Dec preached GenAI as the new technology that is going to make/break companies . Maybe AI is investing in itself intentionally :O. Maybe it is?  Nvidia is overvalued dude, probably will reach 900 and correct to 825 or so before it gets added to the SP500 . AMD and Intel will be adding Intel back into the tech sector biggies shortly due to them entering the 3nm chip manufacturing process .  After consulting with my dad, who has made some bonkers money day trading in his underwear, this was his advice . \"Pay attention to the news. Start educating yourself on the cutting edge of technological advancement and natural resource management\"  You can sell whenever but that doesn\u2019t mean there is a buyer to buy it . Liquidity in options matters because low-liquid options have massive bid-ask spreads . A market maker will always be there to buy your option or sell you an option .  You can sell either option any time, and in the case of American options, it will always make more sense to sell it than exercise early . You'd think so, since you're losing all the extrinsic, but short options do get exercised early .  An algorithm trading the value of the contracts instead of buying the contract itself . Instead of exercising an option, you can sell the contract and go from option to option . Exercising an option means going from option -&gt; 100 shares but you need the money to do so .  Bitcoin is up 165% today according to some users on the market . The market is going higher. I get the feeling we are getting a new ATH in Bitcoin and that will drive it up considerably higher, that is why this is exploding .",

The AI craze has the potential to revolutionise every sector, but there will be hiccups along the way though .

Bought NVDA in 2016 and haven't sold it since, nor have I bought more of it . I've been trying to diversity by buying everything else . Yet, NVDA has outperformed everything else I've invested in .  Nvidia's price target is 3000 by end of 2025 . My charts show me 8,000 by April 2025 . I doubt Nvidia and AMD will run out of room in the next 3-5 years .  There is massive risk to each and it\u2019s the hyper scalers like meta and google building their own AI accelerators which they are already iterating on . They aren\u2019t as good for now but, n Nvidia won't be selling big AI chips for $30,000 each for much longer .

If the stock goes sideways, the contract experiences theta decay, meaning it loses value as time goes on .  If you buy ITM calls (read: they are already ITM *at time of purchase) then yes, it is possible to lose money on those even if the underlying trades sideways . An option is basically 100x leverage on a stock .  The April $880 calls went from $500 (at the bottom) to $50,000, i swear i saw it and thought for a second to buy a couple to average down but brushed the idea . The volume on $880 april was zero with like few 10s as open interest. As for the $1000 june i think there like few . 10s of volume and somewhere around 130 for open interest .

The problem with miners not going up during bitcoins massive run is that they will drop once BTC reverses so its a lose lose lose .  Bitcoin miners are a great way to generate power from solar panel Installations on homes, especially when heating is required . The ROI is tight on whether you break-even without significant price growth in BTC . Fees are already too high for Bitcoin to be used as a payment crypto .  The true value of such services require XRP, not BTC with off-chain transactions . There are services that will do this entirely for you through the open source protocol .  Lightning is a hub and spoke model that will lead to centralization and massive KYC, literally the anti-thesis of Bitcoin . Lightning requires 144mb blocks as per its own white paper to scale and work properly . There's not a high demand to use bitcoin as a payment so not many payment systems using lightning .  Bitcoin is ripping to ATH right now, but it's not the big players, it's the private miners with low debt and operating expenses . The public miners will get crowded out after the halving .  It's almost like equity markets didn't *believe* in the bitcoin rally, too . People think it's going to ping off the ATH and splash to 42k, \"No rate cuts this year!\". Summarization not available for this chunk.  The hash rate ( or difficulty) adjust itself dynamically such that 1 block is solved every 10 minutes . If miners drop difficulty will decrease so more profit for the remaining miners . MSTR &amp; COIN (other than BITO) are only real Bitcoin exposure plays .  The first successful nuclear powered Bitcoin mining operation is going to be wild . It will take miners twice as much in energy to continue their current rate of mining after halving occurs .  Theoretically, it should be about $40kish to mine a single BTC after next halving if hashrate hadn't expanded for all miners . Volatility has often accompanied these halving events, but I don't think there's much value left in mining investments .  Bitcoin's reward rate about to get chopped in half . Miners will still be profitable after the halving and much more so as the bull market continues . Invest in BTC or proxy /ETF .  The halving was priced between November to January . The draw back is a mixture of people swapping from the miners to an ETF for crypto exposure, and/or shorts/market sentiment shifting in short term . Buy the dip hold well into the BTC cycle .  Bitcoin miners are likely to move downward short term leading up to and shortly after the halving . Anyone trying to play options should be looking 12-18mo out, which is historically when bitcoin runs up post-halving . BlackRock pushing BTC price up should be good for miners .  The reward miners will get will be useless considering they\u2019ve been doing this for a while . Miners are more like the day laborers. They make money even if it hits zero, as long as they dump it on pensions/rich/poors .",

It was called \"Attention is all you need\" and it introduced a new way of building AI models using something called Transformers (no not that one). These models were so powerful and versatile that they could do anything from natural language processing to computer vision to music generation. Because it was open source, everyone and their mother started using Transformers for their AI projects, including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.   \n\n\nAnd Google? They've been playing catch-up ever since. I have always wondered why they just gave away their secret sauce for free?

        "summarized_comments": " 13 years working for Google now and i can confirm there is change needed . Google needs a CEO / culture change in the company to reach full potential .  There's so many layers of middle management that all tries to get promoted via a new product, the company ends up competing with itself . Google\u2019s internal promotion system does NOT reward you for doing maintenance work at all . Employees are implicitly encouraged to bin existing working products in favour of new ones .  Google is where Microsoft was in the 2000's. The CEO is a moron. Morale is low. Employees aren't paying attention to what's going on anymore. They're not focused on beating the competition. Instead, they are busy \"playing the game\" to secure raises or promotions .  Google has a patent on the Transformer but it's unenforced, and some people suspect it's actually unenforceable because it forms part of TensorFlow . Their search engine is just ads now, I stopped using it. Their AI generative search is fucking fire for answering questions .  Google has to cannibalize the cash cow (search ads) to win with AI . It's not even clear where the real money with AI is yet . The other tech companies don't have to sacrifice their own revenue to win .  The CEO sucks. He's not managing the company well. No clear direction. Google needs new, fearless leadership if they want to compete in this new world. They need a leadership change, cultural change .  Listen to the most recent episode of the podcast \u201cAll In\u2019s podcast, they break down all the issues with Google . The performance review cycle encouraged PMs to launch new redundant products instead of improving existing ones . They have a ton of data to build strong models on, just need some culture of innovation .  Google are quietly integrating LLMs into the search engine itself, without obviously changing the UX and progressing cautiously and carefully . The most obvious thing to the untrained eye is more multi-modality to the image and video results returned and a lot more \u201cquestion answering\u201d styled search results . Google is the only one that understands that LLMs are just another information retrieval system .  Google is over 90% of search worldwide, so any dramatic change to the UX is going to affect alot of people and that simple UI metaphor of \u201cone box, 10 blue links\u201d has been a winning strategy for a very long time . This is what we call finding the \u201ccurrent context and disposition of the user\u201d  Google has been an AI first company since 2018 and the AI race is theirs to lose. The majority of top OpenAI engineers came from Google. The challenges with Google is management. They have the war chest. They are profitable as hell, a fully matured company, and have a long track record of being at the forefront of tech .  The world of AI is in its infancy. Google doesn't need to participate in the pump dynamics of a sector . They know that the AI sector is a marathon, not a race. The DEI examples with Gemini are not a fundamental flaw in the product. That\u2019s just an overcorrection. It's a cautiousness that's too strong, too strong .  The megacaps are all screwed in the near term due to a wall of innovation . They simply don\u2019t know where to go next due to natural limitations on product development . The average stock, while not in a downtrend, is merely treading water in a range .  The company is down nearly 15% on its high because of nothing . People need to stop tunnel visioning about AI models that are years away from being actually ready for the masses . Google has other businesses other than fucking AI, look at their profit margins .  Google is toast, their AI is a woke disaster, and since they can't make it an actual unbiased AI due to their companies woke ideology . No one has need of an AI that will actively lie and give false information . Google is too big for its own good. Now managers are playing politics to keep their jobs and fiefdom intact .  Get Woke, Go Broke. You'll belong in this sub for eternity . Google is up 100% since covid lol. It's overvalued like all big tech, just not as much as Nvidia .  The market is going to force Google to layoff and probably Pichai to resign . Until then, except for surprise earnings, I don't think Google will go anywhere .",

        "selftext": "**The Essential Greeks:**\n\n* **Delta (\u0394):** Measures an option's price sensitivity to a $1 change in the underlying asset's price. Understanding delta is key for both directional trading *and* for hedging to neutralize risk in a portfolio.\n* **Gamma (\u0393):** The rate of change in delta in response to underlying price movement. High gamma indicates an option's delta will change rapidly, making it more sensitive to price swings. Gamma management is vital for refining hedges, especially in dynamic markets.\n* **Theta (\u0398):** Quantifies \"time decay\", the amount an option's value decreases each day as expiration nears. Theta impacts all option positions; understanding how it accelerates closer to expiry is crucial for timing trades and deciding when to roll option positions.\n* **Vega (\u03bd):** Indicates how much an option's price changes in response to a 1% change in implied volatility (IV). High vega options are more sensitive to IV fluctuations. Traders of all levels should monitor vega to manage the changing risk profile of options as volatility shifts.\n\n**A Few Concepts and Strategies**\n\n* **Implied Volatility (IV):** The market's expectation of future volatility, priced into options. Understanding IV is crucial for determining whether options are relatively expensive or cheap, and for identifying opportunities involving volatility expectations.\n* **IV Crush:** Often occurs following major events like earnings, when uncertainty and IV tend to drop rapidly. IV crush presents opportunities if correctly anticipated\u2014option sellers need to be especially aware of it.\n* **Time Decay Acceleration:** Options lose value at a faster rate as expiration approaches. This affects pricing and is key to deciding when to close or adjust positions, especially for strategies based on selling options for premium.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* **Underlying Asset:** Stock BOFA, currently trading at $100\n* **Investor Outlook:** Moderately bullish on BOFA's short-term prospects, believes the price could rally over the next month, but is also cautious about potential volatility related to an upcoming earnings announcement.\n* **Timeframe:** Options expiring in one month are available.\n\n**Applying the Concepts:**\n\n* **Exploring Options:** The investor observes these BOFA call option details:  \n\n   * Strike Price: $105\n   * Delta: 0.6\n   * Gamma: 0.05\n   * Theta: -0.15\n   * Vega: 0.20\n   * Implied Volatility (IV): 30%\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n* **Delta:** Each $1 move in BOFA should roughly translate to a $0.60 change in the option price.\n* **Gamma:** Relatively low gamma means that delta will change gradually as BOFA's price moves. A significant price move is needed for big delta changes.\n* **Theta:** This option will lose approximately $0.15 in value each day due to time decay \u2013 this loss accelerates as expiration approaches.\n* **Vega:** A 1% increase in IV would cause the option price to rise by about $0.20, all else being equal.\n* **IV:** Moderately high IV implies the market expects significant price movement, likely related to the impending earnings announcement.\n\n**Potential Strategies:**\n\n1. **Moderately Bullish with Delta Focus:**  Buy the $105 call option.  This provides leveraged upside exposure if BOFA rallies, with the delta offering insights into expected profit/loss based on stock price moves.\n2. **Hedging a Current Position:** Suppose the investor owns 500 BOFA shares. To protect their position from a downside drop, they could buy five $100 put options (each option contract represents 100 shares). Careful delta and gamma consideration would be needed to adjust this hedge if BOFA's price moves.\n3. **Benefiting from IV Crush:** Consider *selling* the $105 call option ahead of earnings. This is due to implied volatility (IV) typically spiking pre-event (making options more expensive), then dropping after the news is released (making options cheaper). This strategy is risky, however, as short call positions have unlimited loss potential if the underlying stock price surges unexpectedly.\n\nWhat did I miss?",

        "title": "Why I am bullish on BBAI",
        "selftext": "First, lets start off with some fundamentals. Here are some BBAI statistics compared to PLTR:\n\n* BBAI revenue of 154M, market cap 545M (x3 revenue) \n* Gross margin of 25%\n* EPS growth rate greater than 78% of peers in its industry \n* Current ratio 1.15x assets/liabilities \n* Diversified revenue portfolio is robust compared to competitors \n\nComparing these numbers to PLTR:\n\n* PLTR revenue of 2.2B, market cap 55B (x25 revenue) \n* Gross margin of 80%\n* Earnings beat by 0.003 led to 17-20 (17%) gap up, trending upwards to 25\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBBAI and PLTR sell to the same customers and provide similar services, but BBAI is more diversified (autonomous, supply chain, cybersecurity solutions) and trading at a much lower premium (3x sales vs 25x). BBAI and PLTR are said to be partnered, with BBAI products being integrated into the PLTR foundry. Furthermore, in 2023 BBAI reported a 206M backlog in orders/contracts, and just last week acquired Pangiam, a vision AI company. Much of BBAI's revenue is from contracts with large defense companies such as L3Harris and the US government, very much like PLTR. Given that PLTR beat earnings by a wide margin and has run up over 50% since January, it is not unlikely for BBAI to do the same, especially given BBAI has much larger room to overperform in terms of margin, cost control, and revenue. Similar companies experiencing strong earnings include C3AI last week.\n\nMoving on: market dynamics and **bullish options chain:**\n\n* BBAI put/call ratio at 0.17\n* 5c delta of 0.51 and highest volume, seems to be the current PT\n* MM buying shares to delta hedge selling calls, pushing price up further\n* AI hype and bullish momentum very likely to send BBAI up further\n\nToday, BBAI has run up 25% with another 5% in AH, but there is definitely much more upside to go. Given the high IV and premiums on options combined with the low share price, I am personally long 2000 shares at 4.16. While I know some of you regards are playing BBAI only prior to earnings, I am long-term bullish and therefore buying shares and holding into earnings. Planning to add on more whenever the stock dips and aiming for a price target of **5.75 - 6.75.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's be honest. Any company with \"big bear\" and \"AI\" has got to go up in this current market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: \n\n[Hop on the BBAI train guys, lets make some big bull money](https://preview.redd.it/6jbk4q9ssemc1.png?width=2023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf8eca8b785c98abf2c5c5aa40686a0489718939)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "summarized_comments": " The play is to ride the pump, take the profits then ride puts, ride puts. The company is legit amd has promising future. The IV of BBAI is 96%, huge price swings are already priced in. That\u2019s why you take profits and reinvest after the crash.  Robinhood shows insiders picked up 62 million shares of it already in march guessing some good news to come with earnings . Big Bear AI recently acquired Pangiam, who's CEO Kevin McAleenan becomes the President of Big Bear . There are only 92M shares total. 62M seems like a lot .  The relationship between Big Bear and Palantir is one of mutual benefit . Working in the IC (Intelligence Community) requires a security clearance, which can take anywhere from months to years depending on the classifiication level required . Big Bear insiders own roughly 67% of the company themselves . Summarization not available for this chunk.  This is the reason it\u2019s going up. Not that earnings call or their financials . They bought back 80 million dollars worth of stock on Friday after hours of trading . The people who hold are gonna get wrecked just like SOUN and the many others before it. Their sales are fake. They sell to their own subsidies and just cycle money back and forth. It's called a round trip. The company has high operating expenses, but that has been decreasing QoQ.  Buy high sell low, buy high, sell low and buy high . Buy high, buy low and sell low . Buy low, sell high and buy low. Buy high and sell high. Buy low . Buying high and low again. Buying low and buying low again again.",

        "selftext": "First off, let's talk about TSM, the heart and soul of Taiwan. TSM to Taiwan is what MSFT/APPL are to the US. It will never die, and they're going to run this shit up. Look on Friday, they bid it up 5%. They're going to squeeze it like TSLA in 2021, and NVDA now.\n\nAll this FOMO into semis recently? Well we still got a ways to go, and I'm making fucking money off of it. Overvalued, yes probably, but we are no where near the levels of CSCO in the 2000s.\n\n**Now, why TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML or INTC?**\n\nNVDA - I am balls deep in NVDA shares, but it is too overextended with a 2T marketcap. Can we see it overtake MSFT/AAPL? Maybe. If we run like how we did in 2000, we probably will.\n\nSMCI - Sure there are some fundamentals driving this run up, but lets be honest, its all of us degenerates bidding this shit up and buying calls. The rug can be pulled easily (see when we went from 1000 to 700 in a day), but monkey together strong. Don't see why the S&amp;P 500 committee added this, but oh well.\n\nASML - you fuckheads can't buy it on Robinhood, there is no chance of a squeeze.\n\nINTC - they talk a big game, but they never deliver. So much roadmap slippage. Could not deliver 4nm. Just Ls after Ls. Leadership churn. I know its a retirement home over there.\n\n**SO WHY TSM?**\n\n**-** No one can fucking compete with these guy's yields. Samsung needs to fabricate **FIVE** times as many wafers to even match TSMC's yield.\n\n\\- They are West Friendly - these fucks are building fabs in Arizona, Germany, Japan. Fuck your China invasion FUD. If they invade, our portfolios have bigger issues. TSMC is too important for the West to let China have.\n\nDo your own DD here - [https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php)\n\n**POSITIONS:**\n\n**100 contracts 150C - 4/19  - $31,000 cost basis**\n\n**50 contracts 140C - 4/19 - $28,900 cost basis**\n\nSee you fucks on the moon.",

        "summarized_comments": " TSM is by far the biggest/best maker of chips . Majority of the shareholders are US/EU investors so in essence it's a western company already . There are geopolitical concerns that are completely separate from the efficiency of the company or how much money it currently makes .  The risk of China invading Taiwan and these fabs being lost is a very real, very probable event that might happen . Ego plays a far larger role in geopolitics than it should, but here we are . I suspect Tsm will do a nvda at some point and climb over 400 dollars minimum .  TSM's revenue will only grow 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years . It needs to grow more than its guidance to support SP over $400 (highly unlikely because it takes time to build new fabs) Nobody else produces as many chips as TSM . At $138, it is still cheap though.  The market is pricing in an 8.5% move for the April 19th options so if it moves less than that, you get IV crushed simple as well . The IV is not sure to go up before earnings, not a guarantee .  Reddit was bearish on TSM and bullish on Intel due to China threats and buffet selling while I was loading up the boat . I just had the absolute worst timing with like an hour span lol. I put in an order at the new price and then the price dropped lol.  Everyone needs to buy TSM. Do it for America, you degenerates . Intel has first dibs on sub 2nm machines from ASML . Intel will produce on 1.8 nm node by 2025 while TSMC will be on 2nm node by 2027... Intel will deploy backside power delivery by the end of this year... TSMC wont deploy it before 2027 . Intel's current 7nm (called Intel 4) is as good as TSMC's N5 chip . Intel already recieved the first 6 out of the first 10 \"High NA EUV Machines\" by ASML and TSMC has recieved 0 so far .  Just because you have the equipment to build 2nm doesn't mean you can consistently build high yield waifers unless TSMc spills their secrets . China has been trying to poach tsmc engineers for years with high salaries .  Intel already recieved the first 6 out of the first 10 \"High NA EUV Machines\" by ASML and TSMC has recieved 0 so far . TSMC is the source of the river in this AI race . With a new facility being built in Japan they're solving their china problem .  The only reason it's not 1T market cap is pussy\u2019s scared of Ching Ching Ping Ping Ping bling . The only thing is that ASML has the biggest moat and don\u2019t risk being invaded by china .",

Are the mortgage interest on a payed of property that much lower than else? Like in my country, the loan you get to buy property is a mortgage already.

        "summarized_comments": " The interest rate isn't different enough to give this a approach a significant advantage, if at all . What does make it worthwhile is the ability to make an all-cash offer without having to liquidate any investments . Particularly beneficial for the rich since they often want to preserve the tax basis of their investments .  This is about the rich paying slightly less taxes . Their \"slightly less\" in this case, is still a significantly higher rate than the poor person's tax rate . A poor person is not going to have access to money that lets them execute the strategy that is being discussed .  The rich pay the lions share of all tax revenues - in total . Wealthy people pay a higher tax rate on regular income (or on short term capital gains) Rich people pay higher tax rates . The only thing you have as an advantage is no possibility of not  being approved for financing .  The loan against your securities is likely a short-term, interest only loan . The loan on the securities is just a margin interest loan . There is no amortization, all you have to do is pay interest (which is tax deductible) The advantage is you can make a cash offer .  The Apt complex is not the collateral, my stock and bond portfolio is. The bank really doesn't care if I am massively over paying and the apt complex is only worth 5 million . I could buy the 10 million dollar apt complex then tear it down or do what I want as I own it free and clear .  If the market crashes and your pledged collateral loses value the bank can force you to put up additional collateral . You can potentially just hold onto the loan and keep paying it back until the real estate value recovers .  A regular mortgage loan might actually be better than a SBLOC ( securities-backed lines of credit) long term . They might have lower rates, and I am not at risk if there is a stock market crash of getting margin called . However the process of getting a mortgage is rather slow, the bank has to do their own DD to make sure the collateral is worth 10 million dollars .  If a financial entity gives you a loan against the portfolio as collateral, you now have both money and in some countries, tax break against the mortgage . The mortgage is now used to finance a house you don't live in, but is rented and you have money to invest in your business .  A 1031 is not some parlay in Vegas where you keep sizing-up. If I sell a property for $250,000 and 1031 it for a $500,000 property of similar kind, I will owe taxes on the excess value of the new property . If you can drop 10k or more off the purchase price because you're a cash buyer then it might be worth it .  These lines usually have low rates because they are very safe for the bank to provide . If the client can\u2019t pay the loan back the bank can forcibly sell the stocks to repay . If you can guarantee your stocks will be increasing at a greater than 7% return every year it falls apart .  Rocket denied my application due to all the all my outside real estate limited partnership investments .  My k1\u2019s all show depreciation losses even though they pay 9% preferred returns and I have a high net worth, and income from equities .  Schwab felt some remorse for putting me through the hoops and I also was not happy with how arrogant the rocket folks treated me .  The moral of the story is that if you can pay cash for it, banks typically give you good terms, because you don't actually need the money . Margin loans do not show up on your credit history and do not get tracked as part of your credit score .  The more money you have the easier it is to borrow money in a relatively safe and tax efficient manner and make even more money . Most very rich people have their wealth in assets whether that be real estate or stocks and not on cash . The end result is that the taxes are very low .  Some r/antiwork users say it's just a regular loan with a collateral . The loan is paid-off with after-tax dollars though, so taxes on the loan get paid eventually .  Mortgage rates in Canada are pretty much standard across-the-board (not risk based), so there's no real advantage that's not from negotiating the rate with the broker . It's illegal to get a loan for your downpayment unless it's equity from another asset .  The key here never gets mentioned in the tik tok reels- this is done to avoid paying taxes on highly appreciated assets . The really rich people don't buy a house with cash; it's even more rigged: they buy using their investments .  The glitch that Trump and others have mastered is to borrow so much that the bank is at risk of default when you default . The banks that have lent to them don't want them to fail... their over-inflated assets are worthless... much better to prop them up .  The key is that you can get liquid cash quickly by borrowing against your investments . Getting a loan against your property (mortgage) is generally cheaper but takes more time . Borrowing against them is not taxable income .",

        "selftext": "By \"beat the market\", I'm referring to outperforming a benchmark index like the S&amp;P 500 by using a portfolio of single stocks. I've heard various explanations, and even parroted some, but they all seem to be a bit lacking as an actual holistic explanation. Here are some below.\n\n1. \"All of the historical returns of the global stock market come from about 4% of listed companies.\" While this is interesting, it's not really an explanation. It doesn't explain why identifying those companies is inherently difficult, just that they are relatively rare.\n2.  \"Most hedge funds and other skilled investors don't beat the market\". While I agree this is true, it's simply an observation. There's no explanation.\n3. Efficient-market hypothesis. The idea is that asset prices reflect all available information, so every stock is priced perfectly, and therefore alpha doesn't exist. The problem with this is that no one actually believes that markets are perfectly efficient, even EMH proponents will concede this. It's also assumed that smaller, lesser known stocks are priced less efficiently than larger, more known stocks. So even if you believed that the price of say, Apple, was nearly perfectly efficient, there would still be theoretical alpha with smaller stocks. \n\nIt seems that most people conclude it's extremely difficult to beat the market based purely on observational data, or because someone they respect said so. Are there any research papers or detailed explanations explaining *why* it's actually so difficult?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "summarized_comments": " If there was an easier way to beat the market we would all already be doing it, which would then likely make it no longer as profitable . The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent . The other side of returns is risk. And higher risk makes consistency even harder.  It's crazy difficult to beat the market every year over 10 years, because it means you have to beat everyone . You have to be better on every topic, every time, every year against the smartest and highest funded people in the world .  The longer the view, the harder it is for funds (especially after fees) to continue to beat the market . The main criteria is market cap, US-based, liquidity, and positive earnings .  The s&amp;p 500 is always changing and absorbing new members as they begin to grow market share and out perform . This swells the indexs performance . To continually beat this process you need to be consistently beating on winners, whereas the index just absorbs them .  The more concentrated your portfolio is into well researched businesses, the more likely you are to outperform . Even in tech, I managed to return better than Nasdaq or Nasdaq 100 . I was lucky to have been born with both finance and tech interest .  Bitcoin timing coincided perfectly with something I fully understood, because of already having a background and personal passion/interest in the various \"building blocks\" that made up the Bitcoin network . I was too risk averse to go all in or even close to it, but allocating a decent chunk and doing the work to maintain conviction meant I rebalanced properly and never sold in the bear markets . But I don't have that same conviction with almost any other investing; I just don't know much about AI, EV's etc, so beyond the Bitcoin anomaly randomly matching up perfectly with my interests, I just stick to boring old VTI/VTSAX .  RenTech has beaten the market, and not just beaten it, but beaten it big, every year for almost 40 years . It isn't beating the market that is hard but beating it consistently on a risk adjusted basis .  \"Beating the market\" means outcompeting the best people in the world . Investing in the market is hard, but in reality, it is very hard to do so . One miscalculation can bring you below market returns .  The S&amp;P 500 is a good balance of high returns without amping up volatility too much . Simply leave out habitually underperforming sectors of the market, like utilities, you'll have more volatility but higher overall returns .  Most market underperformance comes from investors acting emotionally based on short term price movements and front page news . When mutual funds have high periods of performance most of their investors tend to still underperform .  People trying to beat the market tends to involve people trying to pick the winners out of the group . Odds of 50% of individual stock investors beating the average is no more likely than 49% or 48% . The challenge for hedge funds is beating the market **and still extracting fees** from their clients .

Please be aware that if your post can be sourced from a less sensationalist publication we will likely require you to do that .  A smarter mind than me might see a bug my recollection of the experiment, if so I will edit accordingly . Ultimately, its very difficult to beat a market where your participation in the market is in part determining its outcome . Beating market consistently requires you to consistently know something, that something else does not know, so I settle for the market profit .  Your submission has been automatically removed because the URL matches one on the /r/Investing banlist due to low quality content or has been used to spam . Please be aware that if your post can be sourced from a less sensationalist publication we will likely require you to do that .  It comes down to this: If something is worth x in the future, we would be buying it at x today &amp; the market would close . The net result is the market return . The act of seeking to beat the market is a self-defeating goal .  The efficient market hypothesis is meant to be a model for how you think about the market rather than something that is considered 100% true . The idea is that there are a ton of incentives for markets to accurately reflect assets values and so finding mispricings is exceeding difficult . The only way someone can beat the market is if someone else underperforms by definition .  Every individual who \"beats the market\" in turn makes it harder to beat the market by definition . The longer the term, the more correct decisions you have to make in order to maintain a higher average return .  There are almost no people who can beat the market consistently, the ones that manage to do it are people like buffet . Buffet thinks you're a moron and that is why his advice is to invest in an index .  The point spread means the betting outcome is a coin flip . For every buyer of Stock A is a good choice to own, there is a seller . Unless Stock A performs exactly as the market does, both the buyer and the seller cannot be right . With stocks the most you can lose is 100%.  The market is merely human progress that is being helped along by the organization of a corporation, and the finances, laws, society, and consumers of a country . The places where it\u2019s easy to beat the market are places that have stagnated or even receded .  The one you're competing against is a supercomputer with better info that can execute trades faster . You can beat the market easily if you all in on the right stock . People invest in funds because individual stocks aren't diversified .",

I should end the year around $190k. Realistically I can afford to cash flow a decent chunk of their college when the time comes but I like the idea of making my money work harder until then. I'd love to be able to fully cover their costs but I'm worried about over funding it at the same time. Interested in feedback on how I might think about this.\n\nEdit: appreciate all the thoughts here. Note that I'm really looking for feedback on the math with the understanding that my assumption is that a 4 yr top tier school will cost &gt;$400k. They want that and so do I. ",

        "summarized_comments": " How much do you anticipate your child's college tuition to cost? 160k is already a very significant amount . $400k in 2030 for one child is a good amount to have . Even USC won't be that much, there are very little schools more expensive than it .  $160k is a ton of money for college and post-graduation . State colleges can be $12-20k per year, but many private colleges cost upwards of $40k/yr .  Overfunding the 529 is a strategy very savvy investors will utilize to a) eliminate taxes b) move money out of their estate c) maintain full access, liquidity and control of their money . Withdrawals for education, room, board, tuition and miscellaneous costs are all tax free . You can also convert excess 529 balances to Roth after 10 years .  If the $160K doesn\u2019t pay for school, the gains in the next 6 years should help . Most 529s have contribution caps, so it\u2019s hard to overfund them, and they are a great way to create inter generational wealth .  Anyone paying more than that for a degree had better be getting paid 100k/yr+ right out of school . Most of the tier 1 schools (but not all) are $70k-80k/year now based on research .  The higher tax rates really are less of a financial burden than having to save such rediculous amounts of money for each kid's education . You could probably support them somewhat from your income . Worst case, a loan to one of those schools is going to be easier to pay back .  529s don't have annual contribution limits, only a total aggregate limit . Contributing over the amount subjects you to IRS gift taxes but you can go technically past it . 529 is one of the few true gifts you'll ever get from the govt.  There are no guarantees in life. If there is not a hardship with putting that money away then more power to you . Unused funds can now roll to an IRA up to a limit, but that assumes your kids have kids .  The Netherlands has a few top-100 (worldwide ranking) universities with maybe \u20ac 12k per year tuition for non-EU citizens . A far better deal than US universities it seems .  The max amount permitted is $35k (as of now) Only up to $35K, and there are other requirements . If your child doesn\u2019t go to university you can always roll for your grandkids .  You can start putting that into a high yield savings account, I think Sofi has 4% right now. That money will be more flexible and can be used for more than just college. I'm only giving my kids enough to have a start .",

        "selftext": "I'm trying to combine these two financial \"rules/math\" and want to see if this is a reasonable expectation.\n\n1. At 7% annual gains, your balance will double every ten years.\n2. If you withdraw 4% a year, your balance will stay stable, as long as you earn 4%+ in annual gains.\n\nTherefore, if someone has $300,000 saved and plans to retire in 20 years, is it safe to assume that in the first 10 years, the balance will double to $600,000 and in the last ten years it will double again to $1,200,000? And by withdrawing 4%, that provides an annual income of $50,000?\n\nThe key factor being that there are no new contributions being added, only the $300,000 original balance is the principle. \n\nOf course there are market down times, inflation, taxes, diversification needs, etc that would need to be added as a buffer, but I'm just gut checking that a $50,000 annual income can be derived from a $300,000 principle 20 years prior.",

        "summarized_comments": " The 4% rule study adjust up for inflation each year and is only meant for a 30 year retirement so is would be 50k only the first year . If possible you would want to have 18months-3years worth of expenses in cash when you retire to not have to withdraw much if anything in a really bad market year .  7% after inflation is about in-line with US historical returns even including market downturns . 5% return on $300k over 20 years would result in $796K and 4% withdrawal would be $32K . But this should be a conservative inflation adjusted estimate .  The annual rate of return for that period spans from -12.7% to 23.6% . Math says this is 7% growth per year (x\\^9=1.843)",

        "title": "\"4 buckets\" theory of long-term automated investing...is there a term for this?",
        "selftext": "Growing up my father told me about an investment philosophy that imagined a handful of buckets (4 in his case, but he said it can me more or less) that each contains assets of a certain type, for example equities, debt, real estate, and commodities.  To start, an equal amount of capital is invested in each of those with the goal of getting maximum money-weighted diversity, so for example, one wouldn't want to just invest the real estate bucket in a house on finland, one would want to spread it across all types of real estate including commercial, residential, retail, etc.\n\nThe next step is rebalancing.  Say the rebalancing is done quarterly, the manager would go in and see that some of the buckets increased in value, some decreased.  The manager would sell the overage in the increased ones and buy in the others to rebalance them back to the allocation baseline.  This repeats every quarter, and can be done automatically, no decisions are required.\n\nThe reason he said this was a good automated investment strategy for the long run is that aside from central banks printing money, money isn't created or destroyed in markets, it simply shifts around.  If properly allocated and diversified, one would never see money drain out all of the buckets at once, only shift between them, and by buying low and selling high, one can ever so slowly create a little bit of alpha while overall keeping a massively diversified portfolio with very low risk.\n\nI'm oversimplifying this example, and in doing so realize I've skipped over some important pieces of the strategy, but since I'm sure he didn't make this up himself and tell only me, my hunch is this is an understood strategy, and I'm curious if it has a name that I can use to research it further.",
