        "selftext": "So, I am not Warren Buffett but I think I have a decent understanding about stock metrics. However, I am struggling to understand this. For one, PE ratios vary depending on where you look. Why? Isn't it just stock price \u00f7 TTM earnings? Furthermore, when trying to calculate one myself, this is how it goes:\n\n$FVRR\nEarnings per share per quarter:\n3/31: .36 6/30: .49 9/30: .55 12/31: .56\nTTM earnings per share: $1.96\nLast close: 23.15\n\n23.15/1.96 = 11.81\n\nSo, instead of the pe ratio being 11.81, why is it listed as 257.22 on Yahoo and 322.93 on Fidelity? Not only are Yahoo and Fidelity way off regardless, but I'm struggling to understand how this is being calculated. Forward PE on Yahoo is 12.08, which is closer, but when I combine the last 4 quarters, I don't get close to what either site lists. What am I missing?\n",

        "summarized_comments": " The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is like a magic number that helps you figure that out . It's the price of one share of a company's stock divided by how much money the company makes per share, usually over a year . If the PE ratio is high, like above 20 or 25, it means investors are willing to pay a lot for each dollar of earnings .  The PE ratio is actually like the inverse (the reciprocal if you want to be more technical) of APR . High APR is good but would correspond to a low PE ratio . Companies like to present \u201cNon-GAAP\u201d metrics which are not officially \u201caccredited\u201d  Non-GAAP figures adjust out recurring items to better demonstrate underlying earnings power or growth . Google has almost one third of earnings as stock based comp, yet the GAAP and GAAP earnings are really close . High growth companies, usually in tech or HC, often adjust out SBC when they are burning cash .  NVDA P/E as listed on Yahoo then look up their \u201cforward P/Es\u201d Trailing earnings is probably what is driving this discrepancy . NVDA management has a good idea of what the next Q4 looks like .  P/E ratio is how much you need to invest for One Dollar of annual earnings . Low PE ratios are generally considered a better value than high PE stocks because that $1 of earnings is a cheaper investment .  P/E is flawed because it completely ignores a company\u2019s debt and cash levels . Charlie Munger called EBITDA \"bullying\" earnings . If you want a single metric to tell you whether to buy or sell, ask a broker .  P/E is calculated as current price dividend by ***forecasted earnings*** - be it 2024E 2025E or NTM . I think the PE ratio is overvalued (the PE of PE is high... financial joke)",

Now, you want to know if it's a good deal or not, right?\n\nWell, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is like a magic number that helps you figure that out. It's the price of one share of the company's stock divided by how much money the company makes per share, usually over a year.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you're thinking about buying a share of a company for $20. And let's say that company makes $1 per share in profit every year.\n\nTo find the PE ratio, you divide the price of the share ($20) by the earnings per share ($1). So, in this case, the PE ratio would be 20.\n\nNow, what does that number mean?\n\nIf the PE ratio is high, like above 20 or 25, it means investors are willing to pay a lot for each dollar of earnings the company makes. Maybe they think the company has a lot of potential for growth, or they're just excited about it for some reason.\n\nBut if the PE ratio is low, like below 15 or 10, it means investors aren't willing to pay much for each dollar of earnings. Maybe they're worried about the company's future, or they think it's not doing so well right now.\n\nSo, when you're looking at the PE ratio, you're basically trying to figure out if the company's stock is a good deal or if it's too expensive compared to how much money the company is making. It's like trying to decide if you're getting a fair price for a really cool toy or if it's way too expensive.",

First, a lot of non-GAAP figures adjust out recurring items\u2014usually things like debt amortization, contingent consideration items, sometimes some sort of currency factor.  The purpose is to better demonstrate underlying earnings power or growth.  \n\nHigh growth companies, usually in tech or HC, often adjust out SBC when they are burning cash because EPS isn\u2019t a terribly useful metric in these instances, and adjusting EPS into something more like a cash flow proxy is more useful.  Many companies simply don\u2019t change there non-GAAP reporting after they become profitable\u2014it makes them look better and the SEC does not like changes to non-GAAP procedures.  \n\nI\u2019m guessing this is what is going on with FVRR.",

If a $20 stock has $1 of annual earnings the PE is 20.

Comparisons to Starbucks without any mention on international expansion makes this a potentially misleading comparison .  Dutch Bros. is a coffee chain that grew fairly fast over the past 5 years from once being a small little PNW chain . I think they\u2019re pretty capped on growth personally, but that\u2019s mostly driven by my belief that their product is not particularly good .  The biggest question is where they\u2019re going to be in 5-10 years. Their products are not groundbreaking or innovative so I don't see their ability to find untapped growth sectors or modes of production/sales that haven't been done before. It's such a slow growing stock, I'd rather put my money into AI unless they announce AI coffee.  BROS stock is too expensive to buy right now, but I find the company interesting . Dutch Bros trades at 989x earnings, which is very high, but they\u2019re so small that they only have room to grow .  As Coca-Cola own the second largest coffee chain in the world, I was asking more along the lines of how is Dutch Bros going to become the next Starbucks? I am just not seeing it. As you said Starbucks has brand value and has become a staple coffee product .",

SBUX 105k for 38k.  It's not all apples to apples and I expect a premium for BROS, but I'd like a better in.

The only real threat I see within the next 6-8 weeks is March CPI coming in hot and backing up the recent hot inflation readings, instead of it turning out to be new year adjustments and the concerns about an inflation resurgence getting dismissed by April (similar to 2023)  The stock market is vastly different than it was pre-covid. Balance sheet? EBITDA? Cash flow? Guidance? Meh! \"Look they said the FOTM buzzword, buy buy buy!!!\"  The roaring 20s are back... The irony. We wanted the bulls to run. Now theyre running and youre scared because some shill wont say sell? The market thinks  it's a buy because they're expecting interest rates to lower .

You should try to gain an understanding of what REITs are designed for (hold assets associated with real estate and spin off a stream of income from them in a manner that avoids double taxation) and understand that you shouldn't expect the types of growth from them that you would get from other kinds of equity.  You also shouldn't take backward looking growth metrics and project them into the future; you need to estimate their future prospects and estimate what value of the expected future distributions that they are likely to make."

Unless we see an accident, the only real threat I see within the next 6-8 weeks is March CPI coming in hot and backing up the recent hot inflation readings, instead of it turning out to be new year adjustments and the concerns about an inflation resurgence getting dismissed by April (similar to 2023).",

        "selftext": "Background: I am a 3rd party seller who sells private label goods on Amazon. I gross annually between $1-2mil in revenue. At first many sellers and I kind of brushed off this new policy change that was initiated on March 1st, 2024. However once digging deeper into it and making shipments to send into Amazon, I realized how much of a vulture Amazon truly is. As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&amp;ref=nslp\\_at\\_33\\_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5\\_en-US\\_ttl\\_rf\\_recent\\_news\\_34https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/\r  \n\r  \nAnalysis:\r  \n\r  \nAmazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:\r  \n\r  \nExpansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.\r  \n\r  \n\"Voluntary\" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:\n\n\\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.\r  \n\r  \nImplementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:\r  \n\r  \n\\- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean\u2014to avoid excessive storage fees\u2014now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.\r  \n\r  \nThis policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of \"low inventory\" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the \"voluntary\" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*Overall Financial Impact:\\*\\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.\r  \n\r  \nBonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.\r  \n\r  \nExtra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.\r  \n\r  \nPosition: 20% of my portfolio is now in AMZN. Even at ATH, I plan to change to 50% weighted in Amazon... This is pissing me off, but I gotta find a way to get my money back somehow.",

I'm up already a bit, I think this company is in its infancy and will become an anti-consumer Amazon for B2B ecommerce, much bigger margins.\n\nI've poked around on their ecommerce platform and it's much better than Alibaba imo. They're headquartered out of CA now. With 22 P/E ratio and market cap less than 2b think over next few years there's a lot of potential am holding long and playing this earning's"

        "selftext": "It seems to me that among the recent Gemini headlines (which I find personally quite overblown, as Meta\u2019s very advanced AI displayed the same flaws, and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot was shown to display some real nonsense as well), people have kind of lost track of the autonomous vehicle business. \n\nWaymo is by far the most advanced technology of all autonomous vehicle companies in existence. I\u2019m not sure if people are fully aware that Waymo already has a commercial driverless taxi service in operation. I haven\u2019t tried it but watched videos and it seems to work amazingly well. People love to nitpick autonomous vehicles and say \u201coh x and y are not working perfectly well\u201d, but let\u2019s be real, human taxi drivers are far from perfect and the service seems to be working far, far better than the average taxi driver. This week, Waymo received approval to run their commercial service in Los Angeles. \n\nWhile most carmakers dabble in their own autonomous driving technology, many of them also have collaborations with Waymo. I see real potential for Waymo to become the de facto provider for most carmakers - the way that for years, many parallel charging networks existed, and very suddenly the majority of carmakers signed on to Tesla\u2019s solution as the dominos kept falling one after the other. \n\nWith all the news around ChatGPT, most investors seem to use \u201cAI\u201d interchangeably with \u201cchatbot\u201d or more generally \u201cLLM\u201d or \u201cimage generation\u201d. But autonomous driving is in fact AI as well.\n\nGoogle also owns Deepmind which has been at the absolute cutting edge for AI for many years now. I feel like most people overlook this because you can\u2019t just go to Deepmind.com and have a conversation with their AI. But they are doing some incredibly advanced stuff in scientific fields. Monetizing all of that is going to be a different story but I feel that from a technology standpoint, Google is very much doing impressive things:\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/29/1084061/deepmind-ai-tool-for-new-materials-discovery/amp/\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-04043-w",

        "summarized_comments": " Waymo's not far from common usage in Phoenix and it's already better (and cheaper) than Uber in most of the city . Despite the memes, man, it\u2019s good, and its easily better than google assistant, which IIRC was already the best phone assistant .  Waymo is objectively better than Cruise, but they\u2019re still far from perfect and it\u2019s really just a matter of time until they suffer the same fate . Car accidents are always going to happen no matter how good autonomous driving gets . Capping liability in any industry is always a regulatory problem .  If Waymo\u2019s autonomous vehicle algorithm makes a mistake then the entire network of Waymo vehicles is going to be suspended from operation every time there's an investigation . Tesla gets probed on like a weekly basis and Cruise had their license suspended, while Waymo did not . How many vehicles can one person manage?  Waymo has one of the better Autonomy systems, but not the best . Waymo requires lots of map data, while TSLA\u2019s self-driving is more capable to adapt to unknow territory .  Tesla has millions of cars driving in various locations everyday; it\u2019s the biggest data hoarder for self driving AI training . I don't think they're a well-run company. They've been relying on the search cash cow forever, and it's allowed them to half-ass a million other projects with no consequences .  The hardware attached to these cars are in the tens of thousands per car . The insurance must be high as pie. And you need an army of people watching the cars to autocorrect in case there\u2019s an emergency . It looks like an unprofitable business model .  Waymo is currently in commercial use without being perfected . Even with Gemini if they had released it long ago with incremental advances Open Ai probably wouldn\u2019t be as popular as it is .",

Something that will cost a lot of money... And they need to figure out how to properly monitive it. Most people don't pay Google anything. We are the product. That's a very different business model. Microsoft on the other hand already has service models setup and checking the AI box is easier than setting up a new service for businesses.

It has lost Google a lot of money.\n\nEven EVs that have the selling point of lower maintenance costs and cheaper fuel/charging costs, governments pushing for it, giving incentives etc. have an extremely hard time gaining adoption and most importantly, making money for the company. \n\nI see self-driving as facing a harder battle for smaller benefit. They have to get past all the regulations, be trusted by customers and the hardest part, customers have to buy into self-driving tech at a price that's profitable to the company.\n\nThe number will differ from person to person, but I don't see many people lining up to pay 5 figures more for a car that can drive itself, or to pay an ongoing fee. Especially if in bad weather conditions the sensors don't work. \n\nGoogle should stick to something that has a good cost to benefit ratio. Something with high gross margins.

                "body": "Traditionally, higher rates meant two things: 1) companies with high debt loads or dependency on interest-rate clients (homebuilders, REITs, at this point also utilities and telecom) were projected to have poor earnings, which meant lower valuations; and 2) every company would have the higher discount rate make their projected future cash flow look far worse, magnified for high growth companies. Basically, higher rates meant worse stock prices.\n\nBut what's happened in the last few years is that no body cares. I think it's partly that the game has changed, with everyone and their grandmother's dog just shoving their monthly paycheck into index funds, buying the dip, whatever. And I think it's also partly that there is so much money that the market doesn't know what to do with itself, so the tiniest dips are absolutely exploded out of like GME-style short squeezes. And it's not just that the present fad narrative of AI is excusing high valuations on tech names. Companies like COST, PG, KO, BA and most others are trading at silly valuations that make truly no sense if investors were actually buying companies.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I think the algos and idiot fund managers of the world will just do what they were taught in their textbooks, which is to buy utilities and REITs and small-cap growth when the Fed drops rates. To accomplish this, I expect some pull back in large cap for a short while. But I don't expect this rotation to last unless they start actually producing good results (for instance, REITs might be the one sector where fundamentals still matter, since they pay out their earnings, and so income-seeking investors demand dividend growth).",

A digital bank is not THAT compelling when times are good and the moment the economy slows the growth story is out and concern over risk exposure/loan book is all anyone is going to care about and you saw that in 2022. If traditional banks are cheaply valued because of risks and increasing regulation, what sort of valuation limitation applies to digital banks? Payments has been commoditized. Fighting over checkout real estate to get a buy now button is not that compelling and being the 12th or whatever fintech to announce stock trading during 2020/21 was more a negative sign than a positive one. Fintech cratered so badly in 2022 too that beyond the various headwinds for the sector there's not going to be the sort of unquestioning support for many names - not all, but many - that it had in 2020 for many years, if ever again.\n\n''emerging markets''\n\nIMO, EM will remain single name story specific. MELI, people looking for the next MELI. Does China do something to finally make foreign investors more comfortable, like maybe remove restrictions on foreign listings, doing away with the VIE situation? Probably not.\n\n''Do you think other sectors''\n\nIndustrials and some utilities are basically mooning over AI energy demand but few people seem interested in that.\n\n''growth''\n\nThere are tons of growth names that are doing amazingly well - look at ELF and CELH in consumer packaged goods.  Tons of other examples. People just hear about tech but plenty of other things are doing well or in some cases spectacularly well.",

Just because the metrics they look at are all turning down doesn't mean they'll say \"we won time to bring rates back down\".\n\nCompared to where rates were historically a low rate environment was the abnormally and a return to higher rates is the norm.\n\nObviously no one including myself know what exactly the Fed will end up doing, but I'm in the camp of \"higher for longer\".\n\nEven if we do see a cut in Q3/Q4 it won't be massive so it won't change the landscape much, if at all.\n\nIn my opinion what we're seeing now is euphoria for cuts that very well may not even materialize. The market is forward looking and I hate to use the term, but they are \"pricing in\" cuts.\n\nIf/when cuts happens I don't think we'll see the massive moves some people are expecting.",

With a trailing twelve months (TTM) return on equity (ROE) of approximately 14%, it also demonstrates efficient utilization of shareholder equity. Moreover, its debt-to-equity ratio of about 0.33 suggests a healthy balance sheet, conducive to sustainable growth.

        "title": "SMCI - My BEAR case",
        "selftext": "I have been hearing a lot of buzz around SMCI lately and there is a lot of chatter about it being put into the S&amp;P at the next rebalance (snapshot date is this upcoming Friday, 08 March 2024 and implement date is the following Friday after close I believe.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am going to make my bear case for this stock by not looking at fundamentals at all and only using basic rebalance principles.  Since the vast majority of Americans have their money passively flowing into these broad indices and not caring about the specific underlying stocks anyways, I think it is only fitting to remove fundamental company analysis entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs it stands, SMCI is trading at $905.48 and has a market cap of $50.65 billion USD.\r  \n\r  \nCurrently, SMCI is trading in the Russell 2000 (RUT). It is the highest cap stock in the RUT by about 3x. This disparity is why I believe that joining the S&amp;P 500 is a death sentence to the stock price, and the downwards pressure and volatility will happen extremely quickly once it is added. I will explain why.\r  \n\r  \nThe majority of investors nowadays invest their money passively through retirement accounts/401k's or just are told that their money is safer if you put it into ETFs. This results in a MASSIVE amount of inflow into a basket of stocks without much/any DD discerning the individual stocks in the basket. As for market cap weighted indices/ETFs, the percentage of that index is based on the market cap of the stock.\r  \n\r  \nIf I put $1,000 into the RUT, as it currently stands, $1.62 of that will be towards SMCI, while the next highest stock, MSTR, will receive $0.51. As SMCI increases in market cap, even more of the inflow into the RUT will get pumped passively into SMCI. This is a self-perpetuating cycle of inflow into the highest capped stock(s) in the index.\r  \n\r  \nNow onto the S&amp;P 500. I am going to compare SMCI to 3M, which has a market cap of $50.77 billion and is currently sitting in the S&amp;P 500. 3M is weighted to 0.12% of the entire S&amp;P, meaning it receives approximately 0.12% of the inflow. If SMCI enters into the S&amp;P, I expect it to receive about the same, 0.12% inflow. Now looking at the daily volume of SPY (S&amp;P ETF) vs IWM (RUT ETF), there is about 5.5x the flow of SPY vs. IWM, meaning SPY gets 5.5x more money going through it daily.\r  \n\r  \nDoing some quick math off this, SMCI is currently sitting at an inflow of 1.62%(IWM) and will turn into 0.12%(SPY). Turning the units of SPY into IWM, we multiply the 0.12 by 5.5, so 0.12%(SPY)\\*5.5(SPY)/(IWM) nets us 0.65%(IWM).\r  \n\r  \nThe ratio of inflow into SMCI immediately after it enters the S&amp;P will be 0.65/1.62\\*100 = 40% of what it is currently getting while outperforming in the RUT.\r  \n\r  \nThis tells me that the inflow into SMCI is going to take a 60% decline overnight as soon as it gets put into the S&amp;P. Obviously there are other factors and the RUT is not the only ETF or fund trading SMCI right now, but the underlying argument still stands that the inflow is going to be GREATLY reduced instantaneously, likely causing a massive shock to the stock price.\r  \n\r  \nThis same calculation can be used on other over or underperforming stocks in their indices if they are set to jump from one index to another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to argue me on this one if you disagree with me!",

Obviously the S&amp;P funds have MUCH higher holdings, and the fact that RUT has much lower amounts but high velocity is the point I am trying to make in my post.

A stellar earnings report and 37% later, it turns out Dell is an AI play much in the way of SMCI. The multiple on Dell has rapidly expanded but I suspect if there is some momentum to this SMCI rally, it will continue with Dell. Dell typically gets forward P/Es in the high single digits, and today it is 17. Its trailing is 27, higher than its typical single digits to high teens trailing multiple.",

        "summarized_comments": " Apple is holding on to a slowly bleeding business model and therefore nickel and dime you for stupid shit like apps in order to support themselves . Androids are more upset friendly, more versatile, more customizable, and more powerful devices .  It's more like Tim Cook has joined the legion of crap CEOs: no vision, no ideas, no new development, just bleeding the customers dry for shareholders and yachts . The only thing not included ever was batteries .  Google is an ads business . Ads require data so you can target ads to customers . Every other product Google puts out is data mining for their ad business . I don't like that the searches feel super filtered now .  Automated backups to a local server not available by default and additional tools . Full backup and restore akin to iOS isn\u2019t even possible without multiple paid third party tools to do so .  The Reddit user is a bot and this action was performed automatically . He is a member of the Wall Street Street Reddit community . He has made $500 from class action lawsuits last year . He says he'd settle for a way to stop the alerts .  5GB is a joke, 50 should be minimum nowadays, 50 is minimum nowadays . I've just moved everything to Google Drive because 15 GB is reasonable enough for online file storage + transfer + transfer .  A lot of people won't use all of the extra space, and people pretty much don't use any of the space . It would cost them a lot more money, sure, but it definitely would not scale linearly the way you calculated it . The only way to do this at such a large scale that makes sense financially .  You have to use it and they don\u2019t give you enough iCloud storage, so you have to pay for more storage . The fact that Steve Jobs is still on the picture where it was introduced and it never changed after is kinda enough to know it\u2019s to little to little . The legal system is so stupid. You\u2019d get like $5 max out of it and the law firm gets millions .  A class action lawsuit ultimately serves to get a corporation to stop doing a thing or punish them for doing it . It\u2019s important to note that often the lawyers do all the work to make these lawsuits happen for free precisely because it pays off when they win . Individuals would either have to collectively pay for representation or sue individually .  Median Apple users makes 43% more than the median Android user . Majority of Apple users by far are fine with paying higher prices . IOS needs work but I pay for Apple News+ to get all my business news, tech news etc\u2026and so I pay an extra $16 a month to get the 50gb of storage .  Apple seems too big to fail right now but don't underestimate what could happen in the next 2-3 years . Apple has a history of being second or third and honestly based on the NVDA CUDA software stack the only ones close to them ironically is Apple because they have been designing their own silicon . this mean appl appl gonna be cheap? This doesn't mean it's cheap? Screw cloud bs. Screw cloudbs. This means it's not cheap. This is not a cheap thing .",

While we don\u2019t need them at home, that\u2019s for sure, I keep 1 at work, 1 in my purse, 1 in my carryon(when I have that many extra), when my parents leave for vacation my mom takes one of my 10\u2019 cords and an extra charger etc. they have come in quite handy and I don\u2019t mind sharing my extra other cords.

Yes the lawyer are the ones making money but a class action lawsuit ultimately serves to get a corporation to stop doing a thing or punish them for doing a thing. It\u2019s important to note as well that often the lawyers do all the work to make these lawsuits happen for free precisely because it pays off when they win without that individuals would either have to collectively pay for representation or sue individually which is both expensive and a waste of the courts time to argue out a hundred cases all about the same exact thing. Actually side tidbit this is similar to why arbitration clauses can go very very poorly for companies because having a million people going through arbitration where you have to pay for each  and every arbitration plus any damages awarded can easily rack up hundreds of millions in costs."

                        "body": "I guess I\u2019m getting fleeced for paying $2.99/month for 50gb of storage on iCloud? I write it off on my taxes, including my phone bill because it\u2019s my personal/work phone but $36/year. To me that doesn\u2019t seem that excessive but maybe I\u2019m out of touch. I have had to use Android phones and I have yet to have a good experience. There are so many different versions out there and the added stress of worrying about security that for the time being I\u2019m sticking with iPhone. I know I\u2019m trapped in their ecosystem but if you want everyone to get 50gb of storage for free on all iPhones, that would make them more unaffordable. 5gb is extremely low (match android at 15gb I agree with that) and I go in knowing that I will be paying for more storage but its not like its a back breaking amount of money. IOS needs work but I pay for Apple News+ to get all my business news, tech news etc\u2026and so I pay an extra $16 a month to get the 50 gb of storage and all the magazines and papers in News+, meanwhile if I just got the WSJ alone it would be $9/month. Oh and a VPN but I would buy that for Android as well.\n\nHey if you hate Apple, don\u2019t use it but I find Android to be a pain in the ass and a time suck to get everything working how I want it. Just a personal preference but after being ransomwared due to being forced to use Google docs/gmail for a project I really don\u2019t trust them. I\u2019m aware Apple is a ripoff currently but I don\u2019t buy a new phone every year nor do I ever plan on buying that AR headset. Also, Apple has a history of being second or third and honestly based on the NVDA CUDA software stack the only ones close to them ironically is Apple because they have been designing their own silicon for years now and could put out a killer AI helper replacing Siri maybe not this next iPhone cycle but the following one that would delete the need for half the damn apps that people use.",

I\u2019m DCAinging this! Google needs a lot of data. It\u2019s not looking good but I wouldn\u2019t write them off .  Google should probably ensure Gemini has access to people's web cams and only support those who fit the DEI narrative . Google has a lot! But that's not how ai is going to be used in the workplace or inside software solutions .  The more you put guide rails on complex systems like this the more you degrade the results . Google is the best positioned to take advantage of the AI revolution by a loooong shot .  AI is going to be serving ads by Google and you won't even know it because it will be like \"Oh hey here's your prompt, you should click here for the best thing your prompt could have\"  Google Cloud is taking market share and growing faster than AWS and Azure . YouTube is growing fast and has no peer . Their ad tech platform (AdSense) is unrivaled . Their mobile OS Android runs on the majority of smart phones and generated 45B revenue from App Store last year .  Facebook is the best bet, along side NVDIA, along with Facebook . There is active caste discrimination at MSFT and GOOG. It\u2019s a huge problem and many agree one of the reasons google is risking to succeed and will be left behind .  Google recently took a hit because their AI was developed to be extremely \"woke\" to the point where it is factually inaccurate and unreliable . The problem with Google\u2019s culture is that it doesn\u2019t allow for self-correction very easily easily .  Google is not a \u201cbreak stuff and move fast\u201d company. Decision making is famously done by multi-stakeholder consensus and changing that will be nearly impossible without significant change at the top . Google\u2019s AI offense has to be selling AI tools to enteprise. The impact on the enterprise business will be vast .  Nvidia is has better social sentiment and momentum than both Apple and Google combined right now . Nvidia has solid fundamentals, great ESG, and great momentum . Apple isn't magnificent at all. Its lack of innovation will catch up with it. And who in their right mind would wear a $3,500 headset on a street?  This week will be a return to megacap like aapl and googl and bynd and crm and meta and maybe even tsla. Google and Apple are screaming buy at these prices. I still feel like we\u2019re getting a pump this week up to 142-145 and then falling off to 130 but im also dumb so. I too like green falling wedgies. I'm doing the same now.

In high school, I briefly interned at a marketing firm. For every photo or video shoot we had to pick our models/actors based on the client\u2019s requested racial/gender ratios. You can make racial/gender requests on most AI generators too.\n\nUnless, of course, you used Gemini\u2019s initial release which hardcoded the algorithm to show a certain % of minorities and genders regardless if it made sense or not in the given context. Google is the best positioned to take advantage of the AI revolution by a loooong shot but they need to shed the woke ideology that has rooted itself within the company (as well as many other large tech corporations). You really want these generative models to reflect the reality of the data as closely as possible - then let the customer tweak their prompts if they have issues with the results. The more you put guide rails on complex systems like this the more you degrade the results.",

They created AlphaFold which is allowing new protein and drug discovery. They just announced AlphaGeometry which can solve symbolic geometry problems. They created GraphCast which is more accurate and faster at 10 day weather prediction than the massive super computer simulations used today. They\u2019re the leader in machine translation with Google translate. These are just a few examples. Anyone who works in the AI/ML community knows Google dominates AI research. \n\nAs for their services. Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, etc) is massive with 3B users. Google Search hasn\u2019t lost any search market share despite all the ChatGPT hype. Google Cloud is taking market share and growing faster than AWS and Azure. Q4 Google cloud growth was 26% and AWS was 13% and Azure 19%. YouTube is growing fast and has no peer. Their ad tech platform (AdSense) is unrivaled. Their mobile OS Android runs on the majority of smart phones and generated 45B revenue from App Store last year.",

AMD is not participating because their ticker is INTC but people search their broker for INTL .  AMD and INTL underdog success story is a much better story . AMD is up 40% YTD - 80% in the last 6 months and 150% year on year . Intel hasn't stood out since tech boom in 2000 so that makes them an underdog . AMD and Intel are not comparable, Intel has a steep climb to catch-up to Nvidia .  AMD already has products that are faster than the H100 with larger memory capacities . Dell has reported significant traction in orders for AMd MI300x for A.I. In this market, you don\u2019t need any education, just buy AI = buy .",

It works in the other way around as well. Too few shares might have an astronomical price hence a very high market cap.\n\nExample: APPLE has almost one thirds of what MICROSOFT has as its share price (180$ vs 410$). Yet they are valued equally, 3T$.",

        "summarized_comments": " Bitcoin is the largest most secure network in the world. That's real. Its not even broken a million dollars a coin. It's whales driving the market. Retail hasn't caught on yet. Bitcoin is going to get priced out, then they chase shit coins and lose money .  Bitcoin is a volatile asset class that produces no revenues, has no intrinsic value, and moves with the market . It's why I am not convinced we go much higher then 120k. It's not even close to what you think it is. The only value btc has is it's not controlled by a gov. It will never compete with visa, it will never replace fiat .  BTC has value as an asset that will not be diluted and doesn\u2019t run the risk of inflation . BTC would need to go 16x to hit a price of $1M per coin . BTC is around $1.1T total market cap .  Bitcoin has no use cases except maybe a store of value if enough people believe it . Some trusted, crypto names were calling for 100-125k last cycle, and I like a fool waited for that, only for BTC to top out at 60k .  The most realistic outcome I see is a reserved estimate of 100-150k . I think the former (running up close to or even over $500k) is more likely: we're headed into a big bull run in the stock market this year . I've seen others calling for 250 to 300 K but I'm not even sure I'm convinced about that .  If $20tril got pumped into BTC it would make the market cap potentially $100tril to $300tril . No there is a global M2 measure . M2 has banking leverage factored in if that's what you're talkign about .  It took Bitcoin around 2 and a half years to regain its ATH. The cycle will repeat itself next halving. If that wouldnt happend I think 100k would happend last cycle. The problem in your \"understanding\", is that Bitcoin is not Crypto ;)  The muscle memory from repeated boom bust cycles in so many different assets over the past seven years is causing these things to go parabolic and people to jump all in and push things to the extremes much faster than before imo. In the first crypto bubble you had the whole skepticism phase play out over the course of years before rising amidst greater and greater skepticism .  The top is near, and the biggest skeptics to end up being exit liquidity . The people calling for the massive run are the same ones who didnt buy btc when it dropped to 15k . Summarization not available for this chunk.  The only rule is to hold Bitcoin for 4 years and you'll be up even buying at the top . Blackrock is shorting SPY QQQ BTC ETH (Go watch chain options mid March April)  Bitcoin is cool and all, but have y\u2019all ever heard of Shiba Inu? The ETF flows have just started and sentiment is really picking up among mainstream media . It's basically a massively large prime number.  This is going to be a slow burn up now, not a volatile jump in and out . Bitcoin has no top because it will always goes up . This is a mega melt up before a melt down it\u2019ll be back to 30K maybe lower by beginning of next yr .",

It more than 20x\u2019d in under 3 years to get to $60k. Sure, it didn\u2019t quite reach the $100k some were calling out, but if you\u2019d bought in at $3300 during Feb 2019 cycle lows, all the way up to $15k in the October 2020 rise, you still made an absolute killing and stayed in the green all these years. Even people who bought the absolute peak last cycle would be up more than 100% right now if they chose to average down during the 2022 crash. Instead most panic sold for huge losses because they didn\u2019t even understand what Bitcoin was and thus had no ability to stomach downturns. They bought as a get rich quick scheme instead of as a hold forever store of value. \n\nI\u2019m not saying Bitcoin is for everyone, but it\u2019s been an incredibly predictable asset for 15+ years. There\u2019s never been a single point in its history where the price isn\u2019t several multiples higher during the next 4 year cycle. And despite this 15 year history, people still struggle to wrap their mind around this fact because they\u2019ve never seen a truly supply-restricted asset before.",

The muscle memory from repeated boom bust cycles in so many different assets over the past seven years is causing these things to go parabolic and people to jump all in and push things to the extremes much faster than before imo. In the first crypto bubble you had the whole skepticism phase play out over the course of years before it began rising amidst greater and greater skepticism.\n\nNow a year removed from a bear market everyone is piling back into risk assets. Look at semis also. Everyone saying this is 1995 of a long bull market. Do people honestly think that in 1995 lots of people foresaw a huge bubble playing out over the next five years? Fuck no. It took at least 2-3 years for companies to form, jobs to be created, trade shows to demo new products, etc. before it got into full gear. We\u2019ve gone through that full cycle in about 14 months this time and most I read fully believe the narrative.",

        "summarized_comments": " \"OP just wanted to experience a stagnation environment ahead of what will soon become a reality for Americans\" \"OP\" is the opposite of investing in something that benefits society, or fills a hole in society .  Amazon is my best performing stock and I think it\u2019s a great buy too . I'm looking in to buying more GOOGL because it's low but honestly I might just hold off for now and build my savings . Ultimately I realized my goal is to create a safety net and retire by my 40s .  50% of portfolio in ETFs like VOO, QQQ, SOXX, and BUG . Other are solid single stock companies like Costco, Eli Lilly, Nvidia, BRK B, Blackrock, Amazon, and MLM . Warren Buffett said if you put $200 a month in VOO for 30 years and it grows at 12% every year (average) you would have $400,000 off of that investment .  The bitcoin user says he lost $1.5 million in the market . He says he's not investing, that's gambling. Don't make the same mistakes.  \"Crypto trading\" is a popular trading tool on the popular alt-coin market . The author is a new convert to the market . He has been down 60% for 3 years but is now back in the green .  Some Reddit users say they've done better than many on Reddit by trading on the site . Reddit user: \"It's not about the destination, it's about the journey... Or some regarded bull shit\"  Just broke even after 4 years today. I was down -73% at one point . I was big into GOOGL in late 2021 when shit started to hit the fan . On my lowest I was . down -10k literally holding stocks of the biggest companies . On his lowest he was down . 10k . on his lowest . on 2 years of waiting and . constantly rebuying lower dips with the little money I had left to break even .  The goal is to hold out for 1 or 2 years so im not really worried about it rn. I'll wait until ratings on GTA  6 come put before I decide to sell or keep it .",

(Most stock advice here is pump and dump scams from Chinese bots.)\n\n3. Read a book from Warren Buffett, and the sole thing I took away from it is this quote: \u201cinvest in things that benefit society, or fills a hole in society\u201d. From that I started looking at what I was investing in rather than just the potential to make money (ie wtf is that penny stock gonna do, or wtf is Blackberry doing to benefit society? On the other hand, Apple is constantly creating new tech, Amazon is the frontlines of delivering even more than UPS, etc etc)\n\n4. Looked at the charts of ETFs like SP500 and VTO etc and realized they constantly beat even the savvy of traders\n\n5. I went tech heavy on my portfolio because we live in a tech heavy world. Simple as. People say \u201coh yahoo and sears used to be the big ones like Apple and Amazon are now, now they\u2019re broke\u201d. Yes, there\u2019s truth to that. But I honestly can\u2019t foresee us not being heavy in tech for the next 20 years. I see Amazon and apple taking over the world and leading us in to dystopian with their monopolies, and I want a piece of that. Amazon is my best performing stock and I think it\u2019s a great buy too. I\u2019m looking in to buying more GOOGL because it\u2019s low but honestly I might just hold off for now and build my savings.\n\n6. Ultimately I realized my goal is to create a safety net and retire by my 40s. Sure, I would love to hit it rich, but the stock market isn\u2019t designed that way. Unless you want to gamble like you\u2019re at the casino, and I\u2019d honestly say gambling at a casino probably has better odds. I don\u2019t have enough bank roll to play around, nor the experience or knowledge, and when it\u2019s all said all that risk for just a few points over what an ETF makes isn\u2019t worth it. And, in turn, by adopting that philosophy I made more money on stocks than approaching it like a gambler. \n\nTl;Dr I started thinking like an actual investor instead of a Reddit regard",

Were you messing with options?  Warren Buffett said if you put $200 a month in VOO for 30 years and it grows at 12% every year (average) you would have $400,000 off of that investment.  I know past results do not determine future gains but ETFs sound like the solid choice for you.  Large Cap, mid cap, and different sectors.  Also, I would invest in Nvidia over Google and Apple.

Meanwhile everyone else who simply bought SPY probably made atleast+50% in that time.\n\nAnd even after that I was too dumb to simply DCA into the SPY or similar ETFs. Likewise if I simply bought SPY anywhere last year I would be up between 8k-12k.\n\nIt really sucks right now but I gave up on trying to have any kind of unique strategy. I am done fucking around and done buying and selling stocks in a short period. Literally everything I ever owned (AMD, Apple, etc.)- If I just held it til now - would've doubled my money. Can you imagine losing money because you sold AMD at $70 price? Yeah that's me.\n\nI now set up an automatic savings-plan that puts $400 each week into SPY and uninstalled my trading APP to never look back except in a couple of years. It feels wrong now at ATH but this is the same I said last November, December, January.. it doesn't stop climbing, so waiting for it \"to drop\" before investing was literally one of the most regarded things I did.

The highest legal fees were awarded to the lawyers against Enron and they made like $100M. The attorneys aren\u2019t due damages. They pay the same role in this case as an attorney would if someone rear ended you and they sued their insurance company .  Nothing should be paid until the board make a final decision on how much Musk will be compensated . The Enron lawyers did not make \u2018like 100M\u201c. The demanded pay for the Tesla suit is 11% . The lawyers are not billing hourly, unlike you claimed .  Tesla CEO Elon Musk lost $50B in court in a pro-business DE court case . Elon Musk should take this question back to shareholders for a vote: does the CEO whom splits his time among a minimum of 3 corporations entitled to the $50 billion that he lost?  People shouldn't need lawyers to defend them from a system that wants to punish them from actions they didn't commit . North Korea is the only countries on earth that you absolutely do not ever want to set foot in .  This is not by chance, this is Wendy's, it's the most murdered profissional in my country . I'm a business owner and frivolous lawsuits are a thing like this, maybe you\u2019re a bad business owner. I need more casino money. I'm not an attorney, but if you'd like to keep losing these suits for less money you can hire me. You're still cunts. Things will get better for you at some point I'm sure .  It took Musk and Tesla years with multiple bench marks for him to earn that $56B, and it took the lawyer one \"F the Rich\" judge that has a \"you earn too much\" chip on her shoulder for the lawyers to earn $6B . The six billion would be paid by Tesla, not by Musk, because the lawyers have Tesla sixty billion dollars back .  When EB Games and Software Etc. died. They must have serious overheads. They\u2019re just insane. I\u2019m going back to law school! Once again proving that lawyers are scum.",

There is just a problem: Your numbers are wrong. The Enron lawyers did not make \u201elike 100M\u201c. [They got nearly 700 million USD](https://www.chron.com/business/enron/article/enron-settlement-7-2-billion-to-shareholders-1643123.php). That was based on the amount of money they got for their clients, 7.2 billion USD, which means they got around 9.5% of what their clients got in total.\n\nThe demanded pay for the Tesla suit is 11%. Which, when looking at other large corporate lawsuits, isn\u2019t immediately too high. They voided a loss of over 60 billion dollars for Tesla.\n\nBy the way, you are also failing in your other argument. Those lawyers are not billing hourly, unlike you claimed. The pay is based on the result of the lawsuit. That has a simple reason: If you are being paid by the hour, it doesn\u2019t matter to you if you win or loose, just how many hours you can bill. So in cases where large sums are at stake, the lawyers will lay out the money, including, in this case, have four different law firms work on the case, and then take maybe 10% of the money awarded to their clients or, in this case, another beneficiary.\n\nThe demands are high, that\u2019s true. But it isn\u2019t nearly as clear as you apparently believe it to be based on completely false assumptions about the pay structure used here. Again, nobody is claiming that that sum is based on hourly wages."

        "summarized_comments": " 99% of the shares are owned by institutions and mutual funds . The future is AI chicken wings . The practical applications of wings is generally more useful than generative ai for applications .  Carvana's interest rates change from car to car . Two identical cars can have wildly different interest rates . I think they dynamically calculate their rates to cover their margin for when they overpay for cars and they depreciate while waiting to be sold .  This is not financial advice, it's all subjective from having experienced them first hand . The way I see it, they're a trash stock but they'll keep getting pumped from the banks, I wouldn't consider it a long term investment but I'd definitely take it for a rollercoaster ride .  A buyer severely overpays for the car due to bad algos telling them the car is worth X . If the car loses value, instead of holding the value, you have to pay more money to get out of the lease . That's not how a lease works .  Carvana actively trys to fuck everyone and prey on naive people, says OP . Being over mileage means you pay a penalty it's got nothing to do with the value of the car . If you're \"under water\" on a lease you just don't buy it at the end of the lease, you give it back .  Carvana has made fundamental changes to their business and cost . They have almost 7.5b in liabilities, and only 7.07b in assets of which only 900m is in cash . The house of cards for them will crash down eventually. They got lucky they got a positive quarter but if/when the market turns they won't be able to last long .  CarMax pays shills to trash Carvana on here 24/7. They are the definition of being underwater. Would you invest in a person doing Uber with little savings driving a 20k car but having a 30k loan on it? They are one misfortune away and your investment is worth $0. Not the company. It is garbage and inflated/propped up by god knows what .  This coming quarter will remain to be bad as remnants from strikes, but moving forward it\u2019s a positive trajectory and they are also working with new clients for distribution partnerships in comedy and music . The drop would be when they declare bankruptcy or when they declared bankruptcy . The stock price has 35% short float .  There was a time during bankruptcy talk that people posted about caravans paying above market value for cars, some had problems even, literally giving away money . Caravana had a billion dollars in assets when they were $7, those assets inflated while EVs became too expensive to afford .  Carvana is using AI to buy and sell car and is the hottest garbage on the market this decade which makes it a sound investment . The CEO's father is a convicted felon due to his involvement in Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal .",

The way I see it, they're a trash stock but they'll keep getting pumped from the banks, I wouldn't consider it a long term investment but I'd definitely take it for a rollercoaster ride for fun.\n\nThis is not financial advice, it's all subjective from having experienced them first hand\n\nOh and P.S. Carvana owns the dealerships (Vending Machines), Silverrock (The warranty company they use) and Bridgecrest (The financial company they use), The dad of the CEO also owns Drivetime which uses the same warranty and financial company.",

It was  different world. And yes, you can easily be upside down on a lease if you have to drive more than you expected and someone fenderbendered you in a parking lot and ran off. Maybe you're so over mileage the warranty is over and scary warnings pops that you have to clear every few miles. \n\nMaybe the based CVNA picking up person only checked the mileage and signed off they received it and you immediately got your check.

For one, you don't magically come out ahead $10k after being down/under water unless the car market went nuts in which case it wasn't carvana over paying it was that everyone was willing to buy the car at that price.\n\nSecond off - if you're \"under water\" on a lease you just don't fucking buy it at the end of the lease, you give it back. If you put too many miles on it or it was damaged (or both) then you're taking the hit and paying directly to whomever leased the vehicle to you.\n\nI'm not buying that CVNA said \"here's $69k for your 2019 BMW M5!\"\n\nEdit: looks like OP paired being in the worst lease position possible with the best Carvana outcome possible, an extreme outlier",

There was a time during bankruptcy talk that people posted about caravans paying above market value for cars, some had problems even, literally giving away money. About 6 months ago I decided to see what my 2014 tundra would be worth to caravana. Market value is about 28k. My father in law who owns a dealership who has sold several of my used vehicles or traded in told me he could clean her up and get about 30k for it. With 102k miles.  Caravana offered me 14k. So what I think is happening are people are so hard up for money, they are selling their cars for anything to stay afloat and they are raking in profits. \n\nThis will end. Caravana will drop. Idk when. Because nothing makes sense. But they will"

This has been building for the better part of 25 years.\n\nThe width of the setup is approximately 506.90%.  The due date I believe for the handle to complete, and meet the neckline, is December 2nd of this year.  Based on the intersection of trend lines, the approximate break point is $67.70.  This gives us a destination of $410.87.\n\nSo, between now and the end of the year, I expect $INTC to reach at the minimum $67.70 based on its central trend line trajectory.  \n\n2W, 1Mo, and schematic attached.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2W](https://preview.redd.it/u6zi6pjh32mc1.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c7aa4b2c0e36419ef1df82de7dcccfbedbca2b6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1Mo](https://preview.redd.it/0i05swvk32mc1.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ec25edf3847928108097b8fb5b7651c8ed98a15)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Schematic](https://preview.redd.it/e7vj9dyo32mc1.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbfcc3aa2d6d9ce3f206980bd90228b667977b12)",

Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on Reddit .  Intel is far behind TSMC and hence their goals is to be #2 foundry by 2030 . 2024 and 2025 are immensely critical for Intel . Intel is not executing well on their servers and laptop/smartphone market is starting to slow down .  Intel hasn\u2019t breached $70 (share price adjusted) since 2000\u2026 But it may very well be a stock to buy for a good retirement 10 or 20 years down the road... not exactly to buy calls . The \"cup\" is like 25 years wide and the handle only a couple years wide .  Intel isn't even worth as much as it was at the peak of the dot com bubble is wild as f**king . The fact that Intel isn\u2019t even worth more than it was before the dotcom boom is wild . In 20+ years, Intel has dealt with reorganisations, security issues, new strategies and new production locations .  Intel needs to drop at least 30k headcount and get more advanced fabs than TSMC . Intel recently got into the GPU game, but it remains to be seen if they can work quick enough to catch up to NVIDIA/AMD/AMD .  Intel's market cap is based on chart lines, not on products / revenue / income growth . Intel is dogshit, technicals don't matter, they need to start making money again . By 2030 they will have revenue in the order of 150B from fab + better than AMD cpus + competitive GPUs .  Intel is half the value of AMD and have the potential to be the most important semi and largest company in the world . Intel sold 20% minor stake for 4B $. The company is such an amazing chip maker yet only you seem to see it and none of the rest of the investing public .  Intel bulls never fail to make me laugh. The real fun\u2019s in AMD and Nvidia are AMD, Nvidia and Nvidia . Intel has some potential but we will see.  They are behind AMD.  Their GPUs are still low end. They are currently getting their lunch eatin' by comps .",

They made some good moves: Bringing back the Altera brand. Setting up Intel Foundry and providing packaging services to other foundries ( important for chiplets). Plus collaboration with Arms and Microsoft at the foundry level. How successful they are will depend on execution. Intel is far behind TSMC and hence their goals is to be #2 foundry by 2030. Not #1 as TSMC executes foundry services at a higher different level. It\u2019s one thing to make chips for yourself and whole different ballgame to comply with customers which will request tweaks and different process adjustments to cater to their requirements. 2024 and 2025 are immensely critical for Intel. If they succeed, I am sure their stocks will see traction despite most people not liking INTC for good reason. I think with the resources they have, US gov backing  and existing and future infrastructure, they are undervalued at 43 $.",

And the issue is that Intel is not executing well on their servers and laptop/smartphone market is starting to slow down.\nSecondly, Intel announced fab nodes 18A,14A,10A which should all come before TSMC 2N but remember the vast majority of volume and revenue comes from mature nodes, so can\u2019t see how Intel will benefit too much. Lastly, Intel\u2019s latest laptop meteor lake has all non CPU chiplets made at TSMC, that\u2019s a bad look and means they can\u2019t compete on PPAC at a given node with TSMC",

INTC is definitely losing the first to sub-2nm fight, but that doesn't mean they can't gain a foothold considering Gelsinger's confirmation that they bet everything on 18A. A duopoly is still better than monopoly, plus the fight between INTC and TSMC would just make ASML investors even richer since both sides source EUVs from them lmao.\n\nIt's not a gambling ticker that gives 100% gains in a yr, but I see it hit $90 by 2029 or 2030 probably.

        "summarized_comments": " When you buy a contract do you have to have the money for the 100 shares in your account? When you are long calls or long puts the most you can lose is the cost of the option which is called premium . You don't need 100 shares to go long call or long put . You need shares when you want to sell calls or puts .  You shouldn't be touching options if you are asking that sort of question . Do a lot of research and learn these tools before even considering it . I want someone to show when they pick an option and later come back to show them selling it for a profit . If you are deep ITM doesn't really matter because your position will have lots of intrinsic value .  If you are only slightly ITM it would be better to just sell or rollover into a new position because theta decay starts to ramp up closer to expiration . By using LEAPS you still have the chance to get better gains than just shares .  Options contracts represent the right to buy or sell 100 shares of the underlying stock . The longer you want the rain check, the more it cost . Options contracts typically represent the price per share rather than the price of the share .  The value of those contracts has increased because the options are now closer to being in the money in a short amount of time . If i sell to close on Monday at open at open i will gain just a little over 50k . The break even price is the price that his option agrees to pay combined with the fees he payed for the option .  Theta bought 8 call option contracts for a premium of $18.92/share . Each option being 100 shares means that for 1 option it cost him 1800 and he can sell it for 8700 . That break even price is for the option price that he bought as if he were going to pay for the 100 stocks in the options to sell .",

                        "body": "The break even price is the price that his option agrees to pay combined with the fees he payed for the option.  so If he were to buy the shares of the option (which here is 1000$ a share)  then include his premium he payed (total fees at about 18-19$, then he would need each share to be at 1018$ in order to profit from it.  So that breakeven is only for the situation in which he purchases the shares of his option.\n\nThe gains that you are seeing are not for this situation.  Those gains and price are for the option itself, meaning if he sold the option (not buying the shares at the 1000 a share price) then he would get that profit because at this time, due to the stock increasing in price, his option is worth 87$ (per share) when he baught it at 18$ (per share).  Each option being 100 shares means that for 1 option it cost him 1800 and he can sell it for 8700.\n\nThe reason the option has more value is because the expiration date is still pretty far out so Theta has not touched it yet.  Someone buying this option from him still has a fairly good chance of the price going higher then it currently is simply because that is a lot of time for it to reach a higher price.  This is why options are more expensive the further out you buy them.\n\nTLDR: That break even price is for the option price that he bought as if he were going to pay for the 100 stocks in the options to sell.  The profits you see in OPs pic are the profits of buying and selling the option  itself  and he's profiting off the current value of the optio",

        "selftext": "\nHey, fellow Costco enthusiasts!\n\nI stumbled upon an interesting piece of news regarding Costco's potential plans for a membership fee increase, and I thought I'd share it with you all.\n\nAccording to a recent article in the CFO Journal, Costco's longtime CFO, Richard Galanti, who has been with the company for nearly four decades, is stepping down from his role. Gary Millerchip, the former CFO of Kroger, is set to take over next month.\n\nNow, here's where it gets intriguing. Galanti hinted in December that a membership fee increase is not a matter of if, but when. Given Costco's past practices, with the last fee hike occurring in June 2017, analysts anticipate that an increase might be announced soon.\n\nWith a new CFO stepping in, it could be a strategic move for Costco to unveil a membership fee increase during its upcoming earnings report on March 7th. This could be an opportune time for the company to make such an announcement, especially with Millerchip potentially bringing in fresh perspectives on revenue streams.\n\nHowever, some might wonder why Costco wouldn't wait later in the year to announce the increase. Well, one possible reason could be to maintain transparency and give shareholders and customers time to adjust. By announcing it early in the year, Costco can demonstrate fiscal responsibility and avoid surprises later on. Additionally, aligning the announcement with the arrival of a new CFO may signal a strategic shift in the company's financial direction, emphasizing stability and proactive decision-making.\n\nSo, fellow Costco aficionados, brace yourselves. It's very likely that we might see a bump in our membership fees in the near future. What are your thoughts on this potential change? \n\nPositions: Thursday at the close fds +%15 otm 1dte.",

        "summarized_comments": " The call price is just insane for this one. I bought one 720 call in Feb. that I closed on expiration day at 740 with a nice gain. However, I can\u2019t bring myself to buy more at the current prices .  The only actual savings in Costco are in the food court and at the pump . Costco is developing a dynamic pricing model based on MSA and concentrations of EVs within a certain mile radius of CostCos.  You watched the Food Theorist video about it, they referenced a bunch of studies in the video, and then you tell everyone you read those studies when all you did was watch a youtube video . It is actually pretty sad how intensely people feel like they need to defend a company just cause they have a false sense of pride from nonexistent savings .  The cost of a Costco membership is $300 a year, but it's worth it for the rest of the year . The cost is a lot less than the price of a grocery store or a supermarket .  The cost of Costco membership has increased significantly in recent years . The price of just about everything has gone up so this wouldn\u2019t be too unexpected .  Rising costs prob will sway them to increase membership prices! Even just 10 bucks would be huge. The hot dog is one of the most iconic things ever from Costco. They will just replace it with something else one day, like how they just got rid of the churros for a cookie. There\u2019s just no way. The churro was not anywhere near the level of popularity .  Costco memberships are worth more than their membership fee . Costco membership is unmatched and they don't have the kind of problems we regularly see at target Walmart and Fred Meyer around where I live .  When exercising an option call, do you need to have cash available to purchase the shares or can you out just sell it at fair market price? For example, I see people making money on NVIDIA call options . Costco has been cracking down on card sharing which has increased their overall numbers .  The price of Costco membership is too high for investors to buy into the company . Membership costs $5-a-month, but a $20 increase is worth it . Costco will meet expectations but guidance will be not so good for the new CEO .  As long as the price doesn't go up, I will be OK . I wouldn\u2019t see short term calls printing . I think for starters they need to increase the price .",

Yeah - you CAN get \u201cfood\u201d cheaper elsewhere, but to get a similar quality of food cheaper elsewhere is considerably more money.\u00a0\n\nAs a specific other example tho: Highline White Elongated Chair Height 2-piece WaterSense Soft Close Toilet 12-in Rough-In 1.28-GPF\u00a0 https://www.lowes.com/pd/KOHLER-Highline-Curve-White-WaterSense-Elongated-Chair-Height-2-Piece-Toilet-12-in-Rough-In-Size/1001097304\u00a0\n\nThis exact toilet is $200 at Costco, was on sale for $140. It\u2019s $220 at Lowe\u2019s, on sale for $180. The same has held true for me for outdoor lighting. Found a light I liked at a hardware store. Was all plastic and twisted out of shape in the first bit wind - $40. $40 at Costco got me a high quality metal and glass fixture that I replaced the other one with and it\u2019s been rock solid.\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019ve a Lifetime brand picnic table in-warehouse right now for $160 that\u2019s going for $225+ everywhere else. Similarly, the Toto washlet bidet Amazon sells for $450 on sale is $350 at Costco.\n\nYou do have to like the \u201cCostco aesthetic\u201d for it to make sense, but if you do, there\u2019s great savings to be had.\u00a0"

It'll continue until we're not not not sure what can happen .  The Reddit user has lost 20k last week and full on tilt mode atm. The best thing you can possibly do is put it into SPY and forget about it for 30 years. Buy the opposite trend in options, about $10 away from where you are .  The bot is a member of the Wall Streetbets subreddit . He is not a financial expert, but wants to bet on a single ticker . His list includes calls on Netflix, Costco, Crowdstrike, Vail resorts and GTLB . The bot has no financial advice, but he has a few good ones .  The GTC 2024 conference March 18th could have great news . Cloud storage companies have been getting raped on earnings this year . Jd.com is looking good also .",

I understand this was a place made to gamble on dumb money but after years of witnessing so many people in OP's exact position lose all of their savings or a significant amount of their net worth, it's become less \"haha what a regard\" and more \"damn, I hope this doesn't ruin his life\". \n\nI'm not going to advocate for the reformation of the subreddit but sometimes I feel obligated to be a voice of reason for some people that I feel like have completely lost their own. I've just seen so many people's lives ruined out of pure desperation to break their middle-lower class chains and the sad reality is that all this does is often make their situations even worse.",

The company merged and the new company was private i think you have to surrender your stocks(sell em to the new conpany) Then after a while you cant sell em anymore and become worthless but hold sentimental value on ebay ( thats how i think it works)  The company that handled the transaction still has the mechanism in place to redeem certificate shares .

You must know what you're doing, or you risk losing all your money. Besides, it's not just about logic; you also need to handle risks, manage your money, control emotions, get enough sleep, and analyze securities. These are the things that put you in the top 10% of those who consistently make money. (Edited)",

Some users say using margin is asking for their portfolio to be destroyed even if they are right .  Elon used 9.4k of actual funds at 4:1 to limit buy purchase 40k of shares . The interest payments on that margin are gonna be awesome, about $142 every month if he has RH gold .  Tesla will exceed 10T cap in a couple years, people's egos get in the way of seeing this insane opportunity . Tesla is not a car company like GM or Ford. Most of the people think Tesla is a car . They are not. In the future you will see robo taxis, personal robots, AI , houses , battery packs on homes etc .  There's no expiration date on shares that will reach new ATH this year or even by summer . I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth at least $6.5B. Just wait and buy more. The app OP is using to trade is RobinHood - Investing for all app .",

        "selftext": "Good evening regards,\n\nHope  your weekend isn't too boring while the casino is closed. My wife has  been spending a lot of time with her boyfriend, and I need to get rich  to grab her attention again. Here's how I plan to do that with CRSP. Let  me know your thoughts, and let's discuss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ CRSPR Theraputics Chart Since IPO ](https://preview.redd.it/xhmf63mz81mc1.jpg?width=1265&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7ccb25430bb86d4197525e866190ebc5c55c1d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why $CRSP In Summary**\n\nCRSPR Theraputics is miles ahead of every other gene-editing company, it's  not even funny. Further strengthened by their partnership with Vertex Pharmaceuticals $VRTX the next 10 years of this company is going to be an absolute wrecking-ball on biotech.\n\n* Recently approved cure for Sickle Cell Disease and Beta Thalassemia with $1.02T revenue opportunity.\n* Strong, long lasting partnership and funding support from $VRTX.\n* Tiny 6.72B market cap, with 15x bagger potential.\n* 2.29B cash on hand and 0 debt with 4.3 years at current burn rate of 131.62M.\n* Realistic chance at approval for therapies / cures in cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n* Significantly less risky to hold now that they have an existing product.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CRSP 6.72B Market Cap. 3\\/2\\/2024](https://preview.redd.it/4by9ey2391mc1.jpg?width=363&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1f0df28486660f4dac1fba50d319c7b6bff781f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Case For Sickle Cell Disease**\n\nCTX001 Casgevy is approved in United States, Europe, Great Britain, Bahrain,  and Saudi Arabia... with Switzerland and Canada submissions in the first  half of 2024. Let's do some math on disease prevalence in approved areas.\n\n* United States \\~85,000 *\\[a1\\]*\n* European Union \\~116,000 (2.6 / 10,000 population of 448M) *\\[a2\\]*\n* Bahrain \\~29,000 *\\[a3\\]*\n* Saudi Arabia \\~934,000 (2.6% population affected of  35.95M) *\\[a4\\]*\n\nTogether this is 1.16M total people within the current radius of approval. Not taking into account those under the age of 12 this is an addressable market of $2.56T at $2.2M per treatment. $VTRX will take 60% of revenue as a part of partnership **giving $CRSP a potential revenue of $1.02T**.\n\n    Bluebird also has an approved therapy, Lyfgenia. Although with a black-box warning for blood cancer and a 3.1 million price tag. Patients and payers would never choose this over Casgevy in my opinion. Leave your thoughts on this. \n    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Case For Beta Thalassemia**\n\nCTX001 Casgevy is also approved for Beta Thalassemia in the same regions as Sickle Cell Disease above. Let's do some math on this as well. The only statistics I've found is *\"The incidence of symptomatic cases is estimated to be approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals in the general population\"* *\\[b1\\]*. Taking 0.001% of total approved area population of 884.643M people we have \\~8846 total people within the current radius of approval. Again, not taking into account those under 12, this is an addressable market of 19.46B. With $VRTX taking 60% of the revenue **CRSP has a 7.78B existing opportunity treating Beta Thalassemia**. Not massive, but will still pad earnings reports.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CTX001 Casgevy has an existing revenue opportunity of $1.03T in only currently approved areas. This will expand.**\n\n    Furthermore, this treatment switches the fetal hemoglobin gene meaning an existing patient can still pass the defective Sickle Cell Trait / Beta Thal gene to their children. This only cures the patient, and does not decrease offspring risk of disease. Despite it being a one-and-done cure, there's still an inflow of new patients as time goes on. \n    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Existing Pipeline**\n\nCRSPR Theraputics is taking on 3 of the major killers, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease *\\[c1\\]*. Existing clinical trials of these can be found on the clinical trials tracking website *\\[c2\\]* with Phase 1 studies estimated completion for 2027. The most  interesting for me is CTX310 currently being dosed in patients with hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia at Phase 1 clinical trials. Showing a 90% reduction in ANGPTL3 production, and in-vivo on target edit of &gt;90% *\\[c3\\]*. This solution can effectively wipe out dyslipidemias in humans that cause plaque build up leading to heart attack and stroke. Unfortunately, most of this pipeline is 3-5 years out before we'd be close to seeing pharmaceutical approvals. Although the target demographic for these is in the hundreds of millions, if not billions of people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Institutional Investments**\n\nLet's talk about the elephant in the room... Cathie Woods owns 10.6% of this company, she may be highly regarded but padding both ARKK and ARKG with a 600M position doesn't seem like an advertisement to sell to ETF investors. In fact, 80% of all existing shares are held by institutions. Just recently a $280M direct offering at $71.50 were privately sold diluting investors by 5% with no effect on the market price *\\[d1\\]*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CRSP Institutional Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/140fcrc991mc1.jpg?width=353&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9883dff556668b1f76fe0d7524b028fed427d4dd)\n\n[Top 10 Institutional Holders of CRSP](https://preview.redd.it/3vovjfla91mc1.jpg?width=547&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f6463e68cab511c916380dca9e3906285fbcf11)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Placing My Bet**\n\nFull  disclosure, I own 400 shares of $CRSP worth $33,680 at an average price of $65.87. I've been buying since September, but it's been on my radar since 2020. Pulled the trigger, and drinking the kool-aid. Looking forward to cashing out a millionaire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My CRSP Holdings For Disclosure](https://preview.redd.it/xmt1dlfd91mc1.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d70f0cf3b2d79231fbc7890b3ce76633791fc41)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Please let me know your thoughts, I'm doing this DD to open discussion about CRSP and gene editing as a whole. I love you.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources**\n\n*\\[a1\\]* [https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/sickle-cell-disease](https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/sickle-cell-disease)\n\n*\\[a2\\]* [https://ehaweb.org/organization/newsroom/news-and-updates/tackling-sickle-cell-disease-the-need-for-a-european-approach/](https://ehaweb.org/organization/newsroom/news-and-updates/tackling-sickle-cell-disease-the-need-for-a-european-approach/)\n\n*\\[a3\\]* [https://www.emro.who.int/emhj-volume-1-1995/volume-1-issue-1/article13.html](https://www.emro.who.int/emhj-volume-1-1995/volume-1-issue-1/article13.html)\n\n*\\[a4\\]* [https://journals.lww.com/hemasphere/fulltext/2022/06003/p1497\\_\\_burden\\_of\\_sickle\\_cell\\_disease\\_\\_results\\_from.1379.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/hemasphere/fulltext/2022/06003/p1497__burden_of_sickle_cell_disease__results_from.1379.aspx)\n\n*\\[b1\\]* [https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/thalassemia-major/#affected](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/thalassemia-major/#affected)\n\n*\\[c1\\]* [https://crisprtx.com/pipeline](https://crisprtx.com/pipeline)\n\n*\\[c2\\]* [https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=%22CRISPR%20Therapeutics%20AG%22](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=%22CRISPR%20Therapeutics%20AG%22)\n\n*\\[c3\\]* [https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.148.suppl\\_1.16908](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.148.suppl_1.16908)\n\n*\\[d1\\]* [https://ir.crisprtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crispr-therapeutics-announces-280-million-registered-direct](https://ir.crisprtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crispr-therapeutics-announces-280-million-registered-direct)",

        "summarized_comments": " The company has zero debt as a research company that frightens me . They burn 130M a quarter on growth and research, not loans . They were smart and sold shares multiple times during the COVID market when the market was valuing them at a $15B company before they hit phase 3 trials .  CRSP has a real product, real revenue potential, and an exciting pipeline that isn't at risk of fizzling out due to lack of funds over the next decade . Saudi Arabia is one of the highest populated regions suffering from sickle cell .  CRSP has the best balance sheet and the largest, most diverse pipeline of therapies, including next gen gene editing techniques . The Sickle Cell treatment should bring in profits of somewhere in the $1 billion-$5 billion range in its lifetime .  This company named themselves CRISPR to try to make it sound like they invented it, but they\u2019re just using a cool but very ubiquitous technology that still has a lot of challenges/ pitfalls to overcome . Key diseases for gene editing will be cancer and lifelong genetic diseases (especially rare diseases where the high price tag will be more acceptable)  Gene editing sounds fancy and all, it has sounded fancy for years . CRSP is using outdated tech, $BEAM can be much more precise with gene editing . I thought about leaps, but I just dont think it's the right time. I will reconsider when we start seeing revenue data from Casgevy in a Q or two .  Is CRSP ahead of Editas ahead of EDIT, or should I gamble on both? \"Intellia is a better bet IMO. Unfortunately, they are abysmally managed and in survival mode. Currently they are banking on revenue using their parent rights which is iffy. I do not expect Editas to be around in 10 years .  There is a risk of infertility, but it's not because of the edit, it's due to the preparation which requires chemotherapy . CRISPR has the age-old contrarianism that we cannot fully control where exactly we create nicks .  CSPR has nothing to do with any of that . CRSP not CRSP, CRSP is CRSP . Sickle cell and beta thal aren\u2019t going to make blockbusters. They\u2019ve got gene therapy for Alzheimer's in Phase 1 with zero competition .  First person to cure a sexy disease wins brand recog from normies, that\u2019s a massive advantage on the stock market imo. Because VRTX medications for Cystic Fibrosis is \"sexy\". Curing Alzheimer's or cancer is tho. Idk shit about this but I\u2019d rather bet on smb who does the big diseases .  The entire innovation sector she primarily invests in absolutely did not have everyone else winning last year . Her ETFs have some meme holdings certainly, but I'm here to make money, and if you look at her holdings unbiased, they aren't significant underperforming .  The dirty truth of sickle cell is that it's a poor person's disease, and no way in hell is everyone going to pay full price for this stuff . The floodgates to treatment do not open right after FDA approval .  The problem is when? Anyone have an idea about the timelines on this tech? When it will really breakout? The company just got approval for Casgevy and progressed their pipeline significantly .",

Looking at the recent earnings guidance CRSP and VRTX both said they have a payer already covering 100M patients in US and Europe.

It's still substantial revenue that will propel the stock to a valuation of 100B or higher. With them getting approvals quickly I expect no less in Canada and Switzerland, along with other regions.\n\nThe point overall is, holding CRSP is no longer risky.

There is a lot of research in that direction with exotic Cas proteins or protein edited Cas9 etc. Point is the firld is still quite in the preclinical space, rather than ready to roll on a phase 2/3 trial. What happens policy-wise if we realize we introduce nonsense/synomymous mutations to patients?\n\nPost CRISPR Nobel prize, I am fully aware for the hype around these therapies, but people tend to forget how investment/labor intensive is to do such research. AI automation is not really applicable, in light of recent research that AI predictions make errors + underlines our continuous gaps of knowledge on a lot of biological circuitry.\n\nIs CRSPR going to change the world? Maybe\nIs it going to happen any time soon ? I doubt it\n\nMiracles do happen as woth the case of Iovance Therapeutics, but I am still sceptical on the potential to suddenly become a cash machine with sole access to these patients for a complete curative option.",

The lifetime cost of sickle cell patients is more expensive and a burden on the health system than 2.2 million. The argument for insurance and government is that it is cheaper to one-time treat a patient than it is over their lifetime.\n\nFor TDT I don't know the argument for it cost wise. It's lesser than sickle cell as it is only blood transfusion dependent. I assume lesser."

                "body": "I appreciate you taking the time to put this together, but I think you're way off.\n\nFirst, the prevalence numbers you quote are for anyone with sickle cell disease. But the spectrum of symptoms people have is wide, spanning from people who almost never have any sickle cell crises, to people who are in the hospital every month. No one is going to spend $2mil to treat someone who isn't coming to the hospital at least once a year, and maybe even more than that. I don't know how for how many people the cost/benefit analysis works out, but I'd speculate it's maybe 10% of the total population.\n\nSecond, no way in hell is everyone going to pay full price for this stuff. You can cross off europe and canada. they have a well established reputation for hard negotiating on price. And so will everyone else because the dirty truth of sickle cell is that it's a poor person's disease. Saudi Arabia is probably the main exception of a rich country with a lot of sicklers. Even in the US. Most sickle cell patients, especially the really symptomatic ones, are poor and black and are on medicaid or medicare. No way in hell in this country is the government going to spend that type of money on their care. You mentioned a few private insurers who have announced coverage of the drug. I'm betting that's a cynical publicity ploy: they probably know they have very few sickle cell patients to begin with, and plan on impossibly high eligibility requirements, that they expect not to buy much of it.\n\nThird, the floodgates to treatment do not open right after FDA approval. Doctors are conservative by nature. Even after approval, they usually wait several years before starting their patients on risky new stuff. Witness the Hepatitis treatments like Sovaldi. Their Total Addressable Market is mind-bogglingly high but they capture only a tiny percentage of that every year (of course, even a tiny percentage of that market yields billions in sales). So it's not like you'll get $1T in sales right away. That's more like lifetime revenue potential which would probably at best translate into maybe $1bil in actual annual sales. which still makes it successful, but not the amazing numbers you cite.\n\nFourth, point #3 is even more important in pharma because the clock on your market exclusivity is ticking... Your patents have a defined lifetime, and your competitors aren't sitting still. They'll be introducing their own alternatives usually in a few years. No one lets a competitor have a multibillion dollar market all to themselves. Again, the hepatitis market is instructive. Sovaldi was the first to market, but they only had that market for a few years before competitors came out. And then their sales cratered.\n\nFinally, fifth point, more a general point about biotech investing. To all my fellow smooth brained apes: it's a much different world than tech investing. Progress is excruciatingly slow, and it's not uncommon to dump hundreds of millions of dollars pursuing a blind alley for 20 years. Yes, out of that muck come some companies that truly change lives and become superstars, but this isn't the realm of a couple of stanford grads working in their garage creating a unicorn startup. As risky as tech investing is, biotech investing is 100x harder to get right and the funds that manage to succeed usually have literal PhDs doing extensive DD on companies before committing. If you don't want to do that type of research, better to YOLO your funds on NVDA's next earnings call :-)",

Most of the mags I bought cost me like a couple bucks each at the most, and a lot of them are selling for $50, $60 plus shipping.\n\nBut, by the same token, I used to have a bunch of old school video game carts, and they were worth an absolute fortune at one point, but I didn't sell them.

        "title": "I think this year and beyond, Amazon $AMZN will have record cash flow and record stock price, and here is why",
        "selftext": "Background: I am a 3rd party seller who sells private label goods on Amazon. I gross annually between $1-2mil in revenue. At first many sellers and I kind of brushed off this new policy change that was initiated on March 1st, 2024. However once digging deeper into it and making shipments to send into Amazon, I realized how much of a vulture Amazon truly is. As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.\n\n[https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&amp;ref=nslp\\_at\\_33\\_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5\\_en-US\\_ttl\\_rf\\_recent\\_news\\_34](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&amp;ref=nslp_at_33_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5_en-US_ttl_rf_recent_news_34)[https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/](https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nAmazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:\n\n**Expansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:**\\- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.\n\n\\- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.\n\n\"**Voluntary\" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:**\\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.\n\n\\- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.\n\n**Implementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:**\n\n\\- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.\n\n\\- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean\u2014to avoid excessive storage fees\u2014now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.\n\nThis policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of \"low inventory\" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.\n\n\\- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the \"voluntary\" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.\n\n\\*\\*Overall Financial Impact:\\*\\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.\n\nAgain, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.\n\nBonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.\n\nExtra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.\n\nPosition: 20% of my portfolio is now in AMZN. Even at ATH, I plan to change to 50% weighted in Amazon... This is pissing me off, but I gotta find a way to get my money back somehow.",

No longer feels any more reliable than Wish/Temu/etc and customer service has tanked entirely. The CEO just dumped $6B in shares. He only sold about 5% of his shares, so he's still bullish.

        "summarized_comments": " Intel is going to do some crazy stuff with AI 2024-2026 . Intel is Boeing without the body count. They are as sluggish as a govt bureaucracy. The only real reason anyone is an Intc bull. Government funding is government funding .  Intel and AMD were the only 2 companies allowed to design x86 processors for intellectual property reasons . Intel replaced the CEO with an engineer with a new strategy . He is turning Intel into a fab for hire to compete with TSMC . Intel has said that they will open up some of their proprietary IP to companies that want to use their fab .  AMD is no longer part of a duopoly where they have an unfair competive advantage in design thanks to their x86 license and an unfair competitive advantage in manufacturing thanks to artificially cheap and subsidized advanced TSMC manufacturing . They are now 1 of a million companies able to design x86 on the 2nd tier fab tech with what little capacity is left after NVDA and AAPL get their fill .  It's false to think that INTC will \"print tendies\" if there's an actual Taiwan crisis . Computers and just about every other type of hardware requires other chips beyond just INTC's chips...And where do you think those other chips are coming from ? INTC was part of the 2000 tech bubble, they never fully recovered .  Intel has lost the marketing war for the last few decades having CEOs who are finance guys or non technical guys . Meanwhile, TSMC always play it safe waiting for Samsung and Intel to sink their cash .",

                "body": "The bull case for Intel vs. bear case for AMD (CPUs)\n\n\nUntil recently, Intel and AMD were the only 2 companies allowed to design x86 processors for intellectual property reasons. These are the main types of CPUs used in PCs and servers, not like the less powerful but more energy efficient ARM chips used in mobile devices and some laptops.\n\n\nIntel manufactured their own and AMD had theirs manufactured by TSMC. TSMC had superior manufacturing technology to Intel because they were highly subsidized by the Taiwanese government and had first mover advantage adopting the last generation of EUV tech, so AMD's chips were better. But the performance gap is pretty much entirely due to TSMC's superior fab tech and should not be priced into AMD's stock.\n\n\nSo, what has changed? Intel replaced the CEO with an engineer with a new strategy. He is turning Intel into a fab for hire to compete with TSMC and he is doing it on the American taxpayer's dime thanks to the CHIPS act. They are leading the charge on the transition to high NA EUV fab technology, which will either turn out to be a blunder OR will give them a hige advantage over TSMC depending on their yields. What's more, Intel has said that they will open up some of their proprietary IP to companies that want to use their fab, meaning potentially anybody could design their own x86 CPUd. AMD is no longer part of a duopoly where they have an unfair competive advantage in design thanks to their x86 license and an unfair competitive advantage in manufacturing thanks to artificially cheap and subsidized advanced TSMC manufacturing. They are now 1 of a million companies able to design x86 on the 2nd tier fab tech with what little capacity is left after NVDA and AAPL get their fill.",

                "body": "The ultimate reasons why INTC didn\u2019t take off are simple:\n\n1) they got super comfortable with their piece of the pie and took it easy. BK clearing out all possible CEO successors and wanting to be unchallenged CEO of the company. This led to a vaccum of leadership.\n2) they massively undersold themselves with the nonsensical mode numberings that most semiconductor companies are marketing. Most folks are out of their depth when it comes to semiconductor process technology. So when they hear TSMC has come out with 5nm and Intel is at 7nm they think wow INTC is soo far behind.\n4) I would even go on to argue that INTC process and TSMC processes are close to parity. The real reason TSMC is favored by almost every company out there is the ease of use of the PDK. TSMC adapted all their PDKs and library offerings for their customers. Intel was stubborn and expected the industry to mend their ways and learn Intels ways of working. Which was absolutely foolish.\n5) The embarrassment of 10nm process node. Intel could have just abandoned this node and still been in the same position.\n6) it\u2019s lazy to say that Intel stopped innovating, Intel leads the way in packaging and with other innovations such as PowerVia. I would go on to argue TSMC hasn\u2019t innovated anything really just kept itself abreast of whatever Intel has done but done it better cause they barely take any technological risks. TSMC always play it safe waiting for Samsung and Intel to sink their cash.\n\nNow that Pat is at the helm I\u2019m sure he\u2019s weeding out all these mis steps, firstly renaming the nodes was an important one. Pat is unique cause he\u2019s an engineer who\u2019s a master marketer. Intel has lost the marketing war for the last few decades having CEOs who are finance guys or non technical guys.",

They will try to sell as much as they can, all while saying how it's the 'crown jewel' of their portfolio. Who knows if the market will be able to see this coming or not, but there will be a dramatic repricing at some point. My guess is that smart money will short it after technical signs of weakness emerge, and it finds a short-term bottom around 90-80. IMO it drops under 50 by EOY.",

It's mostly index funds and is very stock heavy (80% domestic stock). I remember picking the funds years ago but beyond that, I don't know much. I currently contribute 16% of each paycheck and my employer matches $4000 max for the year. \n\nWhat I don't understand is who is actually buying the shares? All I do is contribute and log in every once in a while to see where the value is at. Do I have an actual human broker at Fidelity who sees my contribution every two weeks and just buys a bunch of shares? Does a robot do it? I looked all over Fidelity's site and I can't seem to figure this out. \n\nWould appreciate it. I'm one of those people who needs to know every detail of what's going on with my money and this has been driving me nuts lately. ",

        "summarized_comments": " The actual money is being funded by your employer each payroll . Fidelity debits your employer\u2019s bank account, buys the shares, and funds your account . Some employers do a great job selecting low cost funds from a variety of asset classes including target date funds .  The default is to enroll everyone in the 401k plan and you have to actively opt out if you want . Every pay period your HR department calculates how much you're contributing . The deducts that amount from your paycheck and sends it to the plan manager, who then credits your account and automatically buys the investments you selected (basically a robot)  Nearly all 401K plans offer a pre-tax option, where contributions are (automatically) tax deductible, grow tax-free, and are taxable at withdrawal . Some plans also offer an option to contribute after taxes with tax free growth and withdrawal . Rarer still is a third option where contributions, growth, and withdrawal are all post tax .  The actual names of the fund managers for FXAIX (Fidelity's SP500 Mutual Fund) are listed at http://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911750# [Fidelity] The process is mostly automated, you can also recalibrate your balances so that the money is invested the way you want it .  You buy in every paycheck to a fund managed by your 401k company or some other company . The fund you are buying into then takes this pool of money from everyone else and buys shares of other companies . It holds those shares and begins to show you return on your investment because they go up as other people buy in . Stocks go up because of scarcity - there's now less McDonald's stock available to buy and if buyers haven't changed, the price goes up .  Fidelity will have no human at all who knows or cares about your portfolio at all . The 401k is simply a container for the mutual fund . Fidelity is a trustee and holds all the funds and manages the funds for all employees .  Tipped employees make much more being tipped than they would with a \"livable wage\" Social Security is a scam and it needs a refresh to be beneficial to employees . Any employee who averages $15 bucks an hour for 40yrs with average returns would have over a million at retirement .  The only place you get to double your investment when company matches, twice a month, your whole working career. 100% return,,, before the fund does anything for you at all . The broker places the orders for you .  Now might be a good time to actually look at the funds you're investing it . Look for S&amp;P 500 or total market index funds with low expense ratios . If you want, you can post what you're invested in and the funds available for you to choose from .",

                "body": "Your employer sets up the 401K plan.  Some of the rules are mandated by the government (ERISA) and the rest are set up by your employer.  These rules govern things like loans, fees, how the Rule of 55 would work at your company, whether a Roth option exists, allowing for voluntary after tax contributions, in plan conversions, and most importantly, **the menu of investment choices you have**.  Some employers do a great job selecting low cost funds from a variety of asset classes including target date funds.  Some do a piss poor job and saddle you with bad options, sometimes with exorbitant fees.\n\nYou enroll in the plan, pick your investments, how much you want to contribute each paycheck, select whether you want to auto escalate your contribution amount every year, etc.  These days I think the default is to enroll everyone in the plan and you have to actively opt out if you want.  That's not how it worked when I started working.  You're told about the plan but you have to actively opt to be in.  It's better now for sure.\n\nThen every pay period your HR department calculates how much you're contributing.  The deduct that amount from your paycheck and send it to the plan manager, who then credits your account and automatically buys the investments you selected (basically a robot).  Since investment choices are mutual funds, you get to buy dollars of them vs. shares.  So when you say you want 80% of some domestic index stock fund and 20% in something else, the plan does that automatically.  HR also calculates when you've maxed out and stops the contribution from your paycheck.  They also calculate any matches you're qualified for or any profit sharing scheme.  The balance of what's left is direct deposited to your bank account.\n\nThere are barely any human involvement these days... everything is automated from your employer side in HR/payroll to the plan manager.  About the only time when humans are involved is when they're talking about making some changes to the plan or for periodic meetings just to make sure everything is running as it's supposed.  That's basically it in a nutshell.",

So for example, if you make $100k but contribute $20k into your traditional 401k, your taxable income before deductions would be $80k.\n\nFast forward 20 or 30 years and you're over 59.5 years old, and you start making distributions. Any distributions from a traditional 401k are treated as income at that point. So let's say you take out $50k in a year, the 401k company will send you a 1099-R showing $50k taxable income, which gets filed when you do your tax return, just like your W2 when you were working.\n\nRoth 401k works the opposite way. You get taxed at the time of contribution, just like regular income. So you make $100k in a year, contribute $20k to Roth 401k, and pay taxes on the full $100k. But when you go to distribute funds in retirement, your contributions and any gains are non-taxable. You'll still get a 1099-R, but you won't owe anything on it.",

Social security could be eliminated for the most part if the government just wouldn't tax this money.  Imagine if that money you and employer were putting into SS went straight into your 401k and then on top of it your 401k wouldnt be taxed upon using the money.  People in retirement would be able to afford things travel etc making country stronger because more money is being spent therefore government is getting their tax money in that way.",

The advantage of the livable wage is that you would have more in that 12.8 percent going in and could make working a tipped job be financially possible to retire.  When you have no retirement other than SS you are basically screwed especially working tip jobs where you aren't claiming all your income.  SS is a scam and it needs a refresh to be beneficial to employees.  Any employee who averages $15 bucks an hour for 40yrs with average returns would have over a million at retirement.  Combine that with not taxing it and people would be way better off than the $30k a year SS will pay."

        "summarized_comments": " An 8 percent annual return on investment from your current amount with adding 1000 dollars a month through age 65 would yield approximately 4.4 million .  At 31, I had $0 in my retirement savings . At 41, I have $106k. At 41 with $17.5k Roth IRA. At 28 with 15k, finally in a position to have a 401k .  The man says he saved $155k between his roth, 401k and brokerage accounts . He saved 100% of everything he had, including stuff like personal IRA that normally would be immune to divorce proceedings . The alternative was to pay her alimony for the rest of her life .  The average retirement savings is $150K (average contribution rate of 14%) The longer you hold loans (unless they're 0-1% interest), the more you're paying what you shouldn't .  An Air Force pilot started in the Air Force reserves at 21 . He has 273k in his retirement accounts right now and his partner is around 115k . When he turned 33, largely through a down year, he had 172k .  Retired investor has around 95k in 401k, 38k in Roth IRA, 110k in brokerage, and holding about 40k in cash earning 5.x% . Currently around 115,000 depending on how you would count the HSA . He has::\u00a054,000 in IRA rollover, 23,000 Roth IRA (just started recently)\u00a0179k in 403b or 403b .  A good goal for retirement is 30x what you want to spend per year in retirement (less your expected CPP/OAS/Other Pension etc) If I retired now I would want to retire about 60k/year, less 20k from pensions etc. 40k x 30 and 1.2 million is the number I feel I need .  At 32, at 32, I probably had $20,000 in 401k and $20k a year with my contribution/employer match to 401k, $7k max ROTH IRA . At 42, I looked back on my 401k at 32. I was at 135k in 2014 . I was a couple years behind entering the workforce and 32 was about the time committed to contributing the amount every year .  The average for people under 35 is $49,130, the median $18,880, so you're doing great! You're smack in the 95th percentile based on your age .  At 33,  911 happened and I lost 127k, and today north of 825k . My wife and I used basically all of our capital to buy our first home back in 2017, sold it for a nice profit, and then built a home right before building prices spiked from COVID in 2020 .",

My wife and I used basically all of our capital to buy our first home back in 2017, sold it for a nice profit, and then built a home right before building prices spiked from COVID in 2020. When we took the keys to our new home, it had over $150,000 in equity, and we have a 2.5% mortgage rate. If we get to count that towards \u201cretirement\u201d then I feel like we\u2019ve done well.

Currently have $350k in my checking/savings.  I have another  $105k between all my retirement accounts.  I have $36k in a traditional IRA (Vanguard), I have $9k in a Roth IRA (Vanguard).  I have $68k in a Roth account through my job (John Hancock).  I\u2019m contributing 6%.  I recently opened a brokerage account to buy CD\u2019s / T-Bills to dip my toes in the investing waters.  I\u2019ve been also reading up on ETF\u2019s, stock, mutual funds etc to educate myself for future investing.\n\nGiven I have a lump sum to invest with (I\u2019d be open to put up to ~$200k out there), I was curious if it still makes the most sense to diversify across multiple investments (currently thinking some popular Vanguard ETF\u2019s + T-Bill / CD)?  \n\nI\u2019m not looking to become a millionaire here, but need to start investing to make my money work for me.\n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.\n",

        "summarized_comments": " Lump sum beats DCA about 2/3rds the time if you can't mentally handle lump summing $300k+ then DCA over the shortest period you can handle . The mix of politics, war, and other factors leaves me unsure about this year's economic outlook . I've thought of a solution: allocating 25% of my cash (let's say $100k) from a High Yield Savings Account (HYSA) to index funds .  Top investors rarely consistently beat set it and forget it in the broad market . If you think you are one of them and can time the market, we can't stop you from trying .  Not losing money is important in the stock market business . Not on a broad market index where you are investing for the long haul . You don\u2019t *want* a stop loss. That\u2019s when you put in *more* if the whole market collapses and never recovers you\u2019ve got bigger concerns .  Lump sum wins about 2/3 of the time, but whether it wins depends on how the market does during the DCA period . Lump sum vs. DCA is mostly risk mitigation to make you feel better about it, but the historical odds are on lump sum winning because markets usually go up .  With multiple decades to retirement, compound interest can absolutely turn $200K into over $1 million . Given your age, and the multiple decades you have until retirement, I\u2019d put most of the money in low cost ETFs . Summarization not available for this chunk.  The alternative would be constantly cashing out your investments and DCAing them back in, which obviously no one does. From that perspective we are almost all choosing to lump sum every day. Let\u2019s say my IRA is fully invested (no cash balance) at a 200k balance . When the market opens on Monday, I\u2019ve essentially taken a \u201clump sum\u201d approach by leaving that 200k invested .  Etfs have some built in because it's a group of different investments, but the grouping has a theme . Owning 20 different etfs that are all the same theme isn't diverse . It's more about having your money spread across lots of different types of companies in different industries .",

And when people are telling you there is certainty of positive economic outlook, there is almost always something lurking that no one is considering. \n\nTime in the market is the only thing that has consistently overcome economic uncertainty. \n\nThe top investors rarely consistently beat set it and forget it in the broad market. If you think you are one of them and can time the market, we can't stop you from trying. \n\nIncremental investing is a version of the timing the market if you don't follow it perfectly. Say you are planning to invest 1K every week, but then see the market is way up five weeks in, and think to yourself, well maybe I'll wait for it to drop down a bit and do 2K next week, that's timing the market.\n\nBased on your comment of evaluating the economy's performance to determine your future investments I can very easily see you falling into this trap."

I mean, decades off, but still, multimillionaire.  Ideally maybe 4 million by retirement?  Depends somewhat on what age you retire and what sort of lifestyle you want in retirement.  But still, inflation over long timespans is significant.  Anyway, that's why investing in equities is so attractive relative to CDs and whatnot.\n\nIf it were me, I'd aim to max retirement accounts every year.  $7,000 to IRA, $23,000 to 401k.  That lets the money grow without capital gains taxes for some decades.  \n\nIf your wife has income, ideally she'd aim for the same, another $7k to IRA, $23k to 401k. \n\nIf the savings rate is too steep to maintain, take from that pile of not-retirement money to cover the shortfall.  That'd effectively be converting the excess money to tax-sheltered money in retirement accounts.  \n\nBut always keep a year's expenses in something liquid and relatively safe -- HYSA, CDs, T-Bills, whatever.  You always want an oh-shit fund in case somebody loses a job or can't work due to injury, or you need to replace the roof on your house, whatever.\n\nIf that savings rate is already maintainable, then yeah, excess non-retirement-account money can go to investments at whatever sort of risk profile you like.  Generally you'd aim for lower risk for shorter term, higher risk for longer term.  Like if you intend to keep that money all the way to retirement, probably 100% equities is fine.  If you're looking to throw it at somebody's college expenses in a few years, then maybe lower risk makes more sense.\n\nRe: lump sum vs DCA... Lump sum wins about 2/3 of the time, but whether it wins depends on how the market does during the DCA period (ie. the future).  If markets go up-up-up during the DCA period, DCA loses you money. \n If the markets are flat or down during the DCA period, DCA wins.  So nobody really knows whether it'd win or lose *right now*.  But the historical odds are on lump sum winning because markets usually go up.  DCA is mostly risk mitigation to make you feel better about it.  Which is fine, whatever helps you sleep better at night :-D",

You'll tie up the money in the short term in exchange for a slightly higher return, but the money won't lose value.\n\nWhen people talk about diversification it's generally not meaning stocks vs CDs. Whatever you're talking about investing, the assumption is that you have all your financial needs covered plus an emergency fund and the money you're investing is extra that you won't need for several years. Diversification in investing typically refers to not putting all your eggs in one basket, so don't go buy $200,000 of Google stock. Etfs have some built in because it's a group of different investments, but the grouping has a theme so owning 20 different etfs that are all the same theme isn't diverse. It's more about having your money spread across lots of different types of companies in different industries, different size companies, and in different regions so when something catastrophic happens it won't effect all your investments the same.",

        "summarized_comments": " A good mentor is worth so much and can set you years ahead in life . Invest in a good sonic toothbrush, a dental floss, and a mouthwash 3 times a day, rinse and repeat . Investing in education does not mean taking student loans .  An IRA is an Individual Retirement Account, which is a tax advantaged account and not a specific type of investment . With traditional IRAs, any funds you contribute are able to be deducted on your taxes, and you pay income taxes on it when you withdraw during retirement . A Roth IRA is similar, except you are not able to deduct the contributions from your taxes now . VOO is an index fund that follows the S&amp;P500 Index of the top 500 publicly owned companies .  At the end of the day you need to educate yourself . Start with more \u201cbeginner friendly\u2019s books and build on that . Read both The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins and The Millionaire Next Door .  VOO is great for now (and probably for the next 25 years of your life). DO NOT get involved with crypto or individual stocks . Your goal is to build wealth, not \"get rich\".  If the US economy falters, VOO goes down . If the biggest US companies were not doing well, neither would the small and mid sized ones and vice versa . You should beware though, with these two etf's you\u2019re putting all your eggs in one basket .  You don\u2019t want your portfolio in just one sector or asset . Diversify more once you get a big amount of wealth you want to diversify more . Best opportunities at the moment NFA: solana, bitcoin, TSLA, semiconductors, cloud &amp; ai.  You can get yourself into a mess if you try and chase gains or are always messing with your portfolio . Keep things simple:  SP 500 or a total stock market such as VOO or VTI is a good choice . VTI/VXUS/BITB with 70/20/10 in percentages, respectively . You can vary your %s and funds to fit your investment/tax strategy .  The investing sub is bitter that they missed out on the best performing asset class if the past decade . The worst thing you should do is rush and it's good that you're researching . It's not a terrible idea to have 1-2 sessions with a financial advisor to plan your road ahead .  You will not see good gains I promise you. A class is not good enough to consider yourself a good day trader, it's a job like lawyer, doctor etc. Avoid trading as well. This isn't suitable for anyone who isn't doing it as moreorless a full time job (and who lacks experience and skill on this too).  The protrusion you get when you stab something determines your profit. Breaking and how far you break through the penetrsted point determines your loss. You can gain more from 1 stock but also lose more. With ETFs would should be doing this too, but stocks requires even heavier research and active analysis and tracking of companies you specifically invested into . Real estate is considered a reliable real asset because its a survival need. People need to live, work and earn money and these are primarily done in properties .",

There are two types of IRAs, traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. With traditional IRAs, any funds you contribute are able to be deducted on your taxes, and you pay income taxes on it when you withdraw during retirement. You don't pay capital gains taxes on any growth. This makes it advantageous to invest in an IRA versus a regular brokerage account, in which you pay income taxes and capital gains tax. \n\nA Roth IRA is similar, except you are not able to deduct the contributions from your taxes now. However, you do not pay any taxes when you withdraw, and similarly you do not pay any capital gains tax. Whether a Roth or traditional IRA is best depends on your income and tax situation. If you expect your taxes in retirement to be lower, then a traditional IRA is better. If you expect them to be higher, then a Roth is better. But both are better than a regular brokerage account. The caveat is that you cannot withdraw any money without penalty until you are 59.5 years old -- the idea is to incentivize you to save money for retirement. If you withdraw early, you have to pay a penalty and any taxes owed (there are some exceptions, but generally this is the rule).\n\n*Within* an IRA, you can invest in just about anything. VOO is a specific investment fund, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF. This tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index of the top 500 publicly owned companies in America. This is a common recommendation because this is a good way to get broad exposure to the overall market without paying many fees. There are many other things you can invest in, but something like VOO is a good recommendation for a novice investor."

They track spending habits, build budgets, and he calls people out of they\u2019re doing the wrong things and can\u2019t see why they\u2019re wrong. I personally have gone from -12-15k to having a positive net worth in a little less than a year from following his advice and just learning to make better decisions overall.\n\nSo first and foremost, invest in knowledge. I\u2019d recommend using the Acorns app to learn about investing. It\u2019s very beginner friendly and you can start with $5. Open a HYSA to help the $ you already have keep up with inflation. I use Capital One, it has a 4.35% APR. I also hear a lot of good things about Sofi and they\u2019re at almost 5% rn.",

Ignore investing in bonds for a few decades, if ever. \n\nConsider investing for the long-term.  Markets will cycle and go up and down.  Once you determine your portfolio allocation, stay the course.   You can get yourself into a mess if you try and chase gains or are always messing with your portfolio. Time in the market &gt; timing the market.  Keep things simple. \n\nSP 500 or a total stock market such as VOO or VTI is a good choice.  An equivalent, is just as fine, I'd say.  ***If*** you want intl diversification, go with a fund outside of US such as VXUS or an equivalent. \n\nI'd recommend allocating a portion of your portfolio into Bitcoin.\n\nHere is an example: VTI/VXUS/BITB with  70/20/10 in percentages, respectively. If you just want domestic: VTI/BITB with 85/15.  You can vary your %s and funds to fit your investment/tax strategy. \n\nAs far as pre-tax v post-tax, that is a little more nuanced but not difficult to understand.

                "body": "Sounds like you can take a long-term perspective (i.e., you don't expect to need to cash in your investments soon.)  I am also assuming you don't want to spend most of your time managing your investments, and would be OK with \"getting rich slowly\" rather than trying to hit a jackpot by taking big risks with your investments.\n\nIf this is correct then putting money in a broadly diversified low-fee (i.e., index) ETF probably makes sense. VOO is a good choice but there are others. If you want to go a bit riskier (but still not try to pick stocks yourself) then VOOG or SPYG (focused on large US growth stocks) are good choices. \n\nAssuming you have earned income, put all you can into a conventional IRA or a Roth or a plan offered by your employer especially if the employer offers to match all or part of your contribution to the plan. \n\nThree other things: \n\nTry to build up a cash reserve sufficient to pay your bills for at least 60 days.  Without that you could be forced to sell your ETF investment at a bad time (when it's down temporarily.)  \n\nIf and when you have a child, immediately start putting what you can into a 529 Plan. Every US State offers these, as do some stock brokers (who ride on some State's plan.) The  contributions in these accounts grow free of federal income tax when used for almost any educational expense and funds not used for education can (with some restrictions) be converted into the child's (not an adult, we assume) Roth account.  A great deal!\n\nAlong those lines, if your family comes to depend on your income, when you can, get some \"term\" life insurance. (NOT any other type!)",

                "body": "I'm slightly older than you so hopefully my life stage is similar as well.\n\nTake it easy and slow. The worst thing you should do is rush and it's good that you're researching. It's not a terrible idea to have 1-2 sessions with a financial advisor to plan your road ahead and to learn. It's their professional job afterall and everyone here has no rightful qualification or right to give you good advice. It's great hearing you take a class but don't underestimate the knowledge of professionals either. It's worth the cost even if it's 10 sessions for example (just do research, some advisors are scummy). \n\nBut if you want my opinion (not financial advice), start with a budget. To know how much to invest, you need to know how much you spend on living and free spending costs.\n\nThere are 3 financial categories for most people in a budget: Living costs (required costs to survive, work, eat, and for some... Health), non-priority spending (any excess things beyond the required amount in living costs, hobbies, snacks and takeaway food, liabilities like clothes; jewellery etc.) and finally savings (emergency fund, investments, trust and estate, retirement fund, house deposit etc). Organise your life in detail and place each aspect in its respectful category. It's different for everyone and needs to be AS DETAILED AS POSSIBLE while having some flexibility (like an excess fund and emergency fund)... Not all months are the same cost wise.\n\nOnce you know how much you can invest you need to figure out your plan. Are you investing short term or long term? What's your risk tolerance? How much have you researched? What investment types will you consider? I advise you do not go into speculative investments like crypto, options, futures or high risk investing like leveraged investing. They are dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. Personally is say avoid trading as well. This isn't suitable for anyone who isn't doing it as moreorless a full time job (and who dont lack experience and skill on this too). You will not see good gains I promise you. A class is not good enough to consider yourself a good day trader, it's a job like lawyer, doctor etc.\n\nFor beginners ETFs are a pretty good place to start. But don't mistake what they are, they're not an asset, but a collection of assets. You're essentially buying a pre made portfolio of stocks. Understand that before you go into them. You're right VOO and VTI as well are great ETFs. They measure the s&amp;p 500 and the total us stock market respectively there are also international ETFs which track the global market. If you're investing in 50 stocks, it's better to change your strategy to 1-6 ETFs instead which hold the stocks you like and track them on a broader scale. 6 assets is easier to track than 50.\n\nBonds are also a great investment to look into early on. They're very simple, there is 2 primary types of bonds: Government Bonds and Corporate bonds. Bonds are a way of a business or government to guarantee investors a return for taking on their respective debts. Corporate bonds are a bit more risky but if they're a large and stable company in a stable market they can act similarly. Think of large health care companies or even massive tech giants like apple who have a track record of repaying their debt. Both governments and businesses are given credit ratings based on how reliable they are repaying debt. These are tracked by international organisations and just know A, AA, AAA Is top while the lower the letter, the more unreliable they are. Anything B or above imo is considered reliable, while A or above is considered very reliable. Credit ratings may also use '+' or '-' to add additional tiers to the letters. \n\nYou mentioned ROTH Ira and In addition 401k is similar. These are retirement funds which you can invest into and should only take out funds in specific conditions. I am not in the US but we have our own version in NZ. With NZ's superannuation, you can't take out funds unless a) you're retired or b) you are purchasing your first property (and intend to live in it). Roth and 401k are similar. These have the advantage of employers who are also required to match your contributions to a certain amount. This essentially means you're gaining additional money that isn't yours from your employer. It's a powerful tool for later life income and assets and can get you ahead so don't underestimate these options. \n\nStocks are essentially ETFs but for single companies. They are riskier since you're investing in 1 market, 1 company, 1 sector and 1 industry at a time, whereas ETFs can be multiple different ones which can spread your assets and reduce risk. Think of a flat and wide pin vs a narrow and sharp one. The protrusion you get when you stab something determines your profit. Breaking and how far you break through the penetrsted point determines your loss. You can gain more from 1 stock but also lose more. With ETFs would should be doing this too, but stocks requires even heavier research and active analysis and tracking of companies you specifically invested into. It allows you to pour assets into your exact desired location in an exact percentage of your portfolio. It's great for when you're better on a single or few companies. \n\nWe can also discuss real estate. Unlike the stock market which are abstract assets based on real entities, real estate is skipping the abstract idea of stocks and buying the entity directly (like with collections and art). But real estate is considered a reliable real asset because its a survival need. People need to live, work and earn money and these are primarily done in properties. But the entry is also steep of course. It doesn't return as well as stocks but real estate has a particular and special advantage, it allows high leverage in low interest through leverage and mortgages to purchase additional property. Banks, brokers and investors love real estate more than other investments because they are stable, living requirements and real assets you can touch, hence why they trust it more and provide lower interest loans. \n\nThere is also long term deposits, high yield savings accounts etc. But these are either short term, low yield investment methods are don't yield much but are super safe and stable as long as the bank itself is. \n\nAvoid art or collections as these are based on taste and preference and therefore  their value has no base, so are unreliable on their worth. \n\nThese all have different risk levels and require different approaches to track and maintain. Selecting what investment you want to push with is very important and needs careful consideration and understanding. This is also partly why you create a budget and an investment Road map. It reveals which investment type you usually wanna pursue. \n\nBare in mind each of these also have a recommended holding period. Real estate needs to be held for longer than stocks, usually due to debt and also the materialised profit from it. \n\nThere are also variations in each investment type. There are long term hold ETFs and short term hold ETFs. Difference being how many fluctuations are expected with the respective type. Bonds also have long term vs short term bonds and in addition also have maturing spans. Company stock holding period depends on the circumstance, company, industry etc. These are determined by the investor. Roth Ira and 401k is extremely long term but also has tax cut and employer contribution advantages. \n\nHope this helps!",

The question you\u2019re ignoring is whether dividend-paying companies tend to be better investments than companies that don\u2019t . The idea that the S&amp;P is the benchmark for everything is really only an idea that retail investors have. Financial professionals use benchmarks based on their portfolios .  A consistently profitable company that slowly grows over time and hasn\u2019t cut its dividend in, say, ten years is a great investment . You own the money if its inside the company or your pocket . Super high dividend stocks tend not to have great total returns .  \"Dividends are not \"free money,\" but they are very much part of total return,\" says OP . Dividends that are reinvested acquire more shares, which naturally increases the value of your asset with even slight capital appreciation .  From 1930\u20132022, dividend income's contribution to the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index averaged 41% . But one should not confuse dividends with returns that doesn't really make sense .  The dividend is factored into that 7% total return, whether a portion of it is from capital growth or capital distribution . Pure dividend is not a successful play in terms of total returns, and being a proud r/dividends member, I still wouldn't recommend a pure dividend play .  Most companies with high dividends are not growth companies, they are somewhat stagnant, so you are losing the growth in the price of the stock in favor of the dividend payout . The younger you are, the younger, the riskier you should be .",

Financial professionals use benchmarks based on their portfolios - for example, I created a dividend stock portfolio and I use the SCHD and some other portfolios as benchmarks.

That said, for most of SCHD\u2019s (relatively short) existence it has outperformed SPY, with SPY only barely catching up during the current bull run. \n\nIf you\u2019re considering investments rationally, you should also consider risk and volatility, and understand that minimizing volatility and downside risk is also a very important factor. \u201cDividend aristocrats\u201d, or whatever you want to call the list of firms that consistently keep or grow their dividends over time, have vastly less risk than some of the large-cap tech companies, as well as other firms in the S&amp;P that are prone to massive swings in the market.\n\n&gt; bogleheads would\n\nI don\u2019t regard the silly opinions of \u201cBogleheads\u201d as even slightly important to any investment decision I\u2019ve ever made, so I don\u2019t exactly see why I\u2019d care what they think."

There's a good reason why taking dividends as cash in retirement is considered part of one's withdrawal rate.\n\nDividends that are reinvested acquire more shares, which naturally increases the value of your asset with even slight capital appreciation.\n\nAnd before you regurgitate the \"stock price drops with the dividend\" mantra; such price movement is always temporary.  Stocks return to being responsive to market conditions as soon as they start trading.  The ex-dividend date has only a temporary impact.  This effect is WAY overblown.\n\nSo... I'm not a dividend nut but it's also misleading to be so *completely* dismissive of them.  Dividends have been a part of the investing calculus for many decades, and remain a part of total return.\n\nNow, OP's subject of yield chasing is another thing - such assets tend to depreciate over time, which does indeed change their value proposition.

I\u2019m seeing that VYMI has total returns of about 6.42% annually over 5 years, and those performance reports are based on dividend reinvestment. VOO is 14.68% annualized over that that time.

Making the switch to s&amp;p now is basically saying that the last decade+ is the new normal, and long term historical patterns no longer apply.

But makes it riskier for the seller and the buyer.\n\nLet's say you own NET at 100 and want to sell ATM calls. Great, sell them and collect your premium. If they're called away then no big deal, but when happens when your cost basis is 100, and the stock goes to 60? You can't sell contracts higher than your cost basis because nobody will buy them and they're worthless. So you have to risk selling near ATM for premium. If you then sell let's say a 65 contract and then shares are called away. You just lost a ton of money selling your shares at 65 bucks with a cost basis of 100.\n\nThe same happens with puts. If the stock falls you're holding these shares and it turns into dead money.",

This value, in this situation, means you are losing money on every stage. Now let's assume the stock is kickass. So you made a bit of profit from the puts while everything are cashing crazy money. Or maybe you own the stock and after selling covered calls it started to tank. You will make a bit of money while everyone will make a lot. So basically you strategy is making a lot of money under the condition that you are in a world where everyone are making a lot of money. Hence, \"wheeling\" work at a market where the whole market is boringly flactuating around median price. In this world, IV is low so the gains are also low. And maybe in this world there are better places to invest money then the stock market. In conclusion, the wheel only works well if EVERYTHING is stagnating but somehow the stock market is a bit less stagnating. In other worlds you either lose money due to opportunity cost or lose money due to doing the wrong investment.

Here's my situation (very lucky to be in this position).\n\nI'm 40 and married with a toddler, no credit card debt but owe 220k on a mortgage (3% rate, house is worth 800k plus), and have a car loan of 40k. The only stocks we have are my wife's 401k with about 25k value currently and a Roth IRA I started last year. I previously had a small 401k built up with a company I left and we cashed it out to do a home remodel. We save enough that I can max out the Roth IRA but nothing more that that each year. \n\nHere's the question: My beloved Grandpa left me his coin collection that if sold would be worth at least 70k, if not closer to 100k if I took my time selling. I love coin collecting and would love to teach my son about it and pass down the collection. I also know how much that money would compound in my fidelity account that would be nice to see grow. \n\nI don't discuss finances with my family but I have a feeling there will be large stock portfolios passed down to me from my parents but that's not a known factor and 30 years away. It's enough to make me consider keeping all the gold so I don't regret losing it, when we are getting by just fine but don't have our retirement funded. \n\nWhat would you wiser and more experienced people do? I didn't get financially serious until I got married so I'm a bit behind but doing good and loving life! \n\nTo answer my own question but also open up your ideas, the best solution seems to sell a big chunk to fund a nice account, but keep enough to still have a meaningful collection. I can't picture myself selling though, maybe it's gold fever! The gold bugs would tell me to hold because the country is on the brink of a financial collapse and the dollar will be scrapped for a digital currency in order to wipe out all national debt and in that situation gold would skyrocket and stocks could plummet. After the pandemic shutting things down, without a financial stimulus I could see a collapse happening in the future and I don't like all the national debt. Does that play into investing at all right now when the stock market is booming? ",

What I would do is sell about 50k worth of the bullion and less sentimental collectibles, if applicable. That\u2019ll leave you with 20-50k worth to pass down and teach your son about. With the liquidated 50k you can properly diversify into low risk index funds, stocks with good dividends, max your 401ks and IRAs, etc. I personally would want to get a big chunk of that compounding ASAP. The people telling you not to because society is about to collapse are the same people that told us Y2K was going to cause a collapse, the market would never recover after 2008, and said Bitcoin was just a fad 10 years ago. I\u2019m not a financial advisor, however I tend to trust 100 years of proven, charted data of S&amp;P returns more than people who drank bleach to cure their flu symptoms because a conman billionaire told them to, you know what I mean?"

How do I understand how REITs make money and how to value them? Would these be good buys?\r  \n\r  \nAt 33, I'm new to investing. about 3 years ago, I started an IRA and max that every year. Passive global equity indexing is my bread and butter, followed by actively managed US small cap value exposure. I also have a taxable account that I'm treating like a savings account for a house downpayment (miniature dollhouse with a puddle-side view).\r  \n\r  \nIn my taxable account, I'd say 50% of my holdings are in individual companies. More purchases were made based on the convictions of others than I'd like to admit. I hold BTI, WM, CROX, CVS, CP, KO, ALB, MO and some others. The truth is that I don't understand any of these industries deeply. Many renown investors have advised over the years that if you don't understand an industry/business that you want to invest in, you'd probably be better off buying index funds. I've been shooting from the hip a little and I'm wanting to reel things back in and try my hand at doing a proper valuation.\r  \n\r  \nHow would I go about understanding REITs specifically?

                "body": "Last week was a good one for the market. It statutes off slow but regained serious momentum at the feet of at expectations PCE readings. I had it forecasted as a buying week with a little blood in the middle and that\u2019s exactly what we got. The news besides PCE was lackluster and the earnings were good, but no major catalyst to push the market through the roof. As a trader, we should always keep in a mind that even in a strong trend, there will be a retracement in the opposite direction before a continuation or a new trend. There will always be buyers and sellers. Understanding this will make you a better trader. \n\nThis will be a big week. On the progress of new out week after week, we are in an unprecedented new air with the market. This week, the BIG NEWS is Powells testimony on Capitol Hill and February Job Reports.\n\nHere\u2019s why this is important: Powell is delivering the semiannual monetary policy testimony. This will help give investors a clue about the current state of the economy, the plan to fight inflation and when is the next time interest rates will be cut. All potent news. With the inflation decline slowing, the markets expect 3 cuts this year. Anything less can send us on a selling trend. Anything more will continue the buying streak throughout the year. This is especially important with FOMC meeting in a few weeks to decide the latest fate for that matter.\n\nThe labor market is expected to stay flat at 3.7% unemployment rate. January gave us a boost and I can see the same happening here with the Fed focused in on the number.\n\nYou have some good earnings this week. Retail, some tech and companies in between. I expect another solid week for earnings due to the Kyrie of the earnings being during the holiday season. Should be a good week. \n\nMy predictions: Most of the market and the index prices are above the 50MA. I expect the prices to revert back to average before bouncing and prices testing their ATHs. I would monitor the VIX to get a reading on the volatile of it all. I believe there will be more buying than selling this week. It will start with a little blood but end the week of a good week. \n\n\n\nKey Weekly Resistance/Supports &amp; YTD Patterns for the week:\n\nSPX FUTURES: (R) 5174.25, 5200.25, 5227.00 (S)5062.25, 5029.00, 4999.00\nBearish Flag, Price through upper boundary, Above 50MA\n\nSPY: (R)513.31, 516.17, 519.90\u00a0 (S)510.30, 507.81, 505.07\nBearish Flag, Price through upper boundary, Above 50MA\n\nDOW FUTURES: (R)39175, 39288, 39335\u00a0 (S)39031, 38879, 38768\nBearish Flag, Price testing upper boundary, Above 50MA\n\nDIA: (R)392.32, 393.89, 394.93\u00a0 (S)387.71, 384.77, 383.03\nBearish Flag, Price testing upper boundary, Above 50MA\n\nQQQ: (R)446.60, 448.52, 451.40\u00a0 (S)437.21, 432.54, 429.24\nBearish Flag, Price testing upper boundary, Above 50MA\n\nVIX: (R)13.69, 14.92, 15.51\u00a0 (S)12.99, 12.25, 11.84\nBullish Flag, Price Testing 50MA, Nearing Death Cross",

I'll explain how I identified these stocks however, if you don't care skip to the bottom with the list.\r  \n\r  \n\\### EXPLANATION ###\r  \n\r  \nI'm pulling market data from https://stockanalysis.com/api/screener api. I clean and transform the data resulting in a search of \\~3700 stocks and then use an xgboost model to predict stock price across the dataset. Resulting RMSE is \\~.60 which I consider quite good.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://imgur.com/a/2DrSqxq\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe next step was identifying anomalous stocks which weren't accurately predicted from this model, the idea being that something different is affecting the price of these stocks that can't be explained from the input data. I used an IsolationForest model and Standard Error from the best fit line as my two starting metrics. Each have benefits, but the motivation for using both is standard error gives more consistent results than IsolationForest. Finally I picked 20 of the most anomalous from the combined Standard Error and IsolationForest metrics, and 15 highest each from the individual scores.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://imgur.com/a/92DOezJ\r  \n\r  \n\\### END ###\r  \n\r  \nI've spot checked my results and found many of these interesting, but DD is a different game than data analysis so please if you find this post helpful let us know what you find in the comments or a follow-up post. I've got this process automated and can supply more of these on a regular basis.\r  \n\r  \nAnomalous tickers:\r  \n\r  \nAWR,CHWY,DOC,BIOX,NBTB,BWEN,TTEC,CDE,SND,GFAI,KMX,LMFA,PIPR,ENVA,SHEN,FNWD,URBN,CDIO,ALB,PHM,TNDM,COLD,PD,UGI,IGT,MIRM,VSTO,HCKT,COCO,FLYW,ALNT,SKT,EPRT,RMR,PRO,AWR,CHWY,DOC,BIOX,NBTB,BWEN,SND,CDE,LMFA,GFAI,TTEC,CDIO,UNH,BCAN,PIPR",

My student loan debt is currently under my fathers name (99% sure. Will double check if necessary) and equates to ~14k. I am extremely enticed by investments and the whole principal of money making money, however I don\u2019t know where to start. I have a few grand I would be willing to put towards low risk investments. My plan is not to make money quick, but also I do not want to see gray hairs before I see any profit lol. If anybody has some wise words and/or advice on what I should do next, they would be appreciated.",

        "selftext": "I have been hearing a lot of buzz around a couple of stocks, namely SMCI and NVDA.  I want to discuss what I believe is going to happen in the next two weeks if SMCI lands into the S&amp;P 500 as it is on track to do.\n\nI will mainly discuss SMCI in this post.  As it stands, SMCI is trading at $905.48 and has a market cap of $50.65 billion USD.\n\nCurrently, SMCI is trading in the Russell 2000 (RUT).  It is the highest cap stock in the RUT by about 300%.  This disparity is why I believe that joining the S&amp;P 500 is a death sentence to the stock price, and the downwards pressure and volatility will happen extremely quickly once it is added.  I will explain why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe majority of investors nowadays invest their money passively through retirement accounts/401k's or just are told that their money is safer if you put it into ETFs.  This results in a MASSIVE amount of inflow into a basket of stocks without much/any DD discerning the individual stocks in the basket.  As for market cap weighted indices/ETFs, the percentage of that index is based on the market cap of the stock.\n\nIf I put $1,000 into the RUT, as it currently stands, $1.62 of that will be towards SMCI, while the next highest stock, MSTR, will receive $0.51.  As SMCI increases in market cap, even more of the inflow into the RUT will get pumped passively into SMCI.  This is a self-perpetuating cycle of inflow into the highest capped stock(s) in the index. \n\nNow onto the S&amp;P 500.  I am going to compare SMCI to 3M, which has a market cap of $50.77 billion and is currently sitting in the S&amp;P 500.  3M is weighted to 0.12% of the entire S&amp;P, meaning it receives approximately 0.12% of the inflow.  If SMCI enters into the S&amp;P, I expect it to receive about the same, 0.12% inflow.  Now looking at the daily volume of SPY (S&amp;P ETF) vs IWM (RUT ETF), there is about 5.5x the flow of SPY vs. IWM, meaning SPY gets 5.5x more money going through it daily.\n\nDoing some quick math off this, SMCI is currently sitting at an inflow of 1.62%(IWM) and will turn into 0.12%(SPY).  Turning the units of SPY into IWM, we multiply the 0.12 by 5.5, so 0.12%(SPY)\\*5.5(SPY)/(IWM) nets us 0.65%(IWM).\n\nThe ratio of inflow into SMCI immediately after it enters the S&amp;P will be 0.65/1.62\\*100 = 40% of what it is currently getting while outperforming in the RUT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis tells me that the inflow into SMCI is going to take a 60% decline overnight as soon as it gets put into the S&amp;P.  Obviously there are other factors and the RUT is not the only ETF or fund trading SMCI right now, but the underlying argument still stands that the inflow is going to be GREATLY reduced instantaneously, likely causing a massive shock to the stock price.\n\nThis same calculation can be used on other over or underperforming stocks in their indices if they are set to jump from one index to another.",

We also have levered derivative ETFs as well that likely account for a lot of the volume since they utilize options.\n\nMy argument is simply that SMCI is so wildly over performing in the midcap area that the move into the large caps will be a volume shock to the downside after it is put in.  The lead-up to the inclusion will cause the stock price to likely be even more volatile to the upside since it will overperform it's current basket by an even larger amount, causing even more buying pressure from passive investors.\n\n  \nAs for the after hours movement, it could be an anticipation of the index having to buy the underlying shares for the inclusion.  If the SPY has to own shares of SMCI in whatever proportion of it's holdings, it will buy those up front and likely increase the price when it does.\n\nI suppose we will see in a couple of weeks what happens.",

In addition to newer entrants like Robinhood and Webull, established houses like Fidelity and Ameritrade/Schwab (recently merged) charge next to nothing for basic buy &amp; hold investments.\u00a0\n\nIn terms of what to invest in, if you don\u2019t have much to invest and/or don\u2019t have a really good reason to hold a specific company, the best bet is typically an index fund. That more or less means a fund that doesn\u2019t try to hand-pick companies, just buys everything within a certain basic criterion:\u00a0\n\n- The stocks on the S&amp;P 500, which are more or less the 500 biggest US companies - funds include VOO, IVV, or SPLG\n- Basically all US stocks - funds include VTI, ITOT, or FSKAX\n- Basically every stock worldwide - only one comes to mind, VT, but you could accomplish the same by splitting the money across two funds, one US and one not, like SWTSX &amp; SWISX.\u00a0\n\n(Side note, the reason for multiple funds using the same approach is basically different companies. It shouldn\u2019t matter a ton who you pick.)\n\nThe benefits to this approach are: \u00a0\n\n1. You\u2019re not attaching your fortunes to any one company, but to the overall idea that companies will keep inventing and selling things.\u00a0\n2. As a result you don\u2019t have to monitor things that closely; the fund adjusts as companies grow and shrink, appear and disappear.\u00a0\n3. These funds charge very low fees. Of the funds I listed, I believe SWISX has the highest fees at 0.06% per year of your balance.\u00a0",

That's not reachable for some people who have way too much debt or if they have kids/housing expenses that are out of wack.\n\n1st. Make sure you have an emergency fund - ideally several thousand dollars in a bank that you could instantly extract for an emergency. Think broken bones, jail, car randomly dying, toilet breaks.\n\n2nd. Once you have that, open a ROTH IRA. Roth Ira's are beneficial to low income individuals for a range of reasons:  (accidentally hit tab and posted)\n\n1. You can extract 10k from it for a first time home purchase without penalty\n2. Certain other emergencies and educational expenses can be pulled out\n3. You can withdraw your own contributions at any time (you just can't put them back in).\n4. As a low income person, your income tax will never be lower than it is now, so the tax shelter that a TRAD IRA provides is moot for you (us).\n5. You can sell your stocks without it counting as income (tax benefit). \n\nIf you're at the lower end, it may not be possible to max a roth IRA without boosting your income or purposefully over contributing (beyond that 20%).\n\nThe bulk of people invest their money in 3 main ways.\n\n1.) Open an account with Edward Jones or a similar \"retirement\" focused advisor service and just let them handle it. This is generally the least efficient option for lower income folks because they charge you fees and commissions for their \"help\" that, due to the small size of your account, will really inhibit growth and their help/advice will not functionally differ from approach #2.\n\n2.) Index investing. John Bogle sort of pioneered this approach. You buy a broad index of the best American companies, another index of all US stocks, and then a smaller portion of the whole world. In this way you capture \\*some\\* of the out performance of the best companies, while capturing minimal downside risk (as downside is spread across the whole index). So your account will still take a beating if the stock market has a major incident (like 2008), but you'll never go to 0 and your losses should be lower in such an event.\n\n3.) Individual stock picking. There are \\*many\\* different ways to do  this. I consider myself a value investor so I look for companies that are absolutely hated by the market, but whose financials suggest they shouldn't be nearly so hated - in the hopes that in the future the market will realize its mistake and then it will be desperate to buy. Warren Buffet is sort of the figurehead of this style of investing today. There are also investors that \\*only\\* buy founder-run companies, others who invest only in specific sectors that they think will out perform, and yet others who broadly invest in say 25-30 S&amp;P 500 stocks.",

Just this year I started working in a company that offers 401k which I been putting 8% of my check weekly which is about $140 a week. They match up to 2% I believe. I\u2019m currently working 60 hours a week plan is to stay here for about 10yrs which then my house will be paid off ($900k). Then change jobs to only work around 50 hours a week. So question is should I just keep 401k n keep putting as much as I can or only put 2% to get the match n rest to Roth IRA? 401k sounds better because I\u2019ll be working less hours so less taxable income when I eventually pull $ from 401k but am I wrong?

It gives you tax credits. When you file taxes it will calculate how much taxes you owe based on your taxable income and then minus $8k in your situation for the child tax credits.\n\nIf you are married you are in the 22% tax bracket unless your spouse makes over $100k, then you would be in the 24% bracket. It would likely benefit you to do some pretax contributions to avoid paying 22% tax on that amount\n(Plus any potential state tax). But it is also good to have Roth funds in retirement so I think it is good to put money towards both. Just my opinion.\n\nAlso if you have 4 kids you should be adjusting your withholdings to withhold less on your paychecks so you don\u2019t get a huge refund (not sure how much money you get back)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI've been considering whether I should start investing in a Roth IRA now or stick with my regular brokerage account. I'm 19 and trying to make smart financial decisions for my future.  \nWith my current job, I can contribute about $100 per month to a Roth IRA, which fits within my budget. I understand I can only contribute up to the amount I make in a year if I cant max it out. Some people say I might miss the accessibility of funds in a regular brokerage account, but after looking into it, I'm not too worried.  \nIn a regular account, I can sell stocks and use the money, but I'll have to pay taxes on any profits. However, with a Roth IRA, I can't touch the profits until I'm nearly 60 without penalties, but I can withdraw the money I put in without any penalties or taxes. So, the accessibility concern isn't a big issue for me since I'm planning on keeping it for retirement.  \nI've done the math, and even with just $100 a month and a 7% return, starting a Roth IRA now could mean an extra $50,000 in my account by the time I retire compared to waiting 3 years until I land my first full-time job after college where I plan on opening one anyway.  \nSo, what's the downside of starting a Roth IRA now? I don't really see one. It seems like a smart move to take advantage of compound interest and set myself up for a better retirement later on.  \nWhat do you all think? If my logic is wrong anywhere please let me know. Right now it seems like it would be dumn to continue to invest in a taxable account before a Roth. ",

At the time they were massively in debt and were making money in a confusing assortment of ways. \n\nQuotes from Barron\u2019s:\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-ge-stock-price-pick-ceo-larry-culp-8ce1498c?mod=panda_barrons_custom_topic_alert\n\nGE have sold off a LOT of assets to reduce their massive debt.\n\n&gt; GE has repaid some $100 billion in debt since the end of 2018, bringing its debt load down to just $21 billion. What\u2019s more, free cash flow, which had dropped from $5.6 billion in 2017 to $2.3 billion in 2019, has started growing again: GE generated $5.2 billion in 2023 and should produce more than $6 billion in 2024.\n\nGE is in the process of splitting itself into multiple companies instead of being a mishmash of unrelated products from light bulbs to jet engines. The conglomerate, first started by Edison, is a going to be a very different thing. \n\n&gt; the early 2023 spinoff of GE HealthCare Technologies, which makes medical imaging products, shares of General Electric have gained about 120%, while GE HealthCare has gained 50%. Both have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index, which has advanced 30% over the same span.\n\n&gt; The final move is due on April 2, with **General Electric splitting itself into two.** The parent company will be renamed GE Aerospace, and will be a maker of airplane engines; and the power business will be spun off and named GE Vernova. **Shareholders will receive one GE Vernova share for every four GE shares.**\n\n&gt; Buying General Electric stock ahead of that split could well pay off handsomely. There\u2019s a strong case that the two new stocks together will be worth more than the existing shares.\n\n&gt; The truth is, all three of the new companies will be dominant players in their respective industries and, remarkably, all three will have investment-grade credit ratings.\n\n&gt; GE Aerospace, though, is the crown jewel. Three-quarters of new single-aisle jets made by Boeing and Airbus carry GE engines, and they\u2019re also found on twin-aisle jetliners like the 787 Dreamliner and jet fighters like the F-18 Hornet. In total, there are more than 40,000 GE engines in commercial airliners and 26,000 in military aircraft.\n\nThis is what I\u2019ve honestly been drooling about. The ability to get GE\u2019s aerospace business without being hampered by its credit business, and its thousand other businesses. That\u2019s what this split entails. You want their healthcare, you can invest directly in that. \n\nConglomerates are early 1900s organizations that benefitted from anti-trust practices. They could lower the costs of a sector to starve out competitors knowing they have income from completely other revenue sources.\n\nBut those days are gone, and investors want more focus in their companies. It\u2019s why some of the big tech companies lately have laid off workers and shut down projects. Like apple\u2019s car, and googles many side endeavors. \n\nSorry, big quote ahead but a lot of good data.\n\n&gt; Both Boeing and Airbus expect the global airline fleet to grow to some 50,000 planes over the coming 20 years, up from about 25,000 today. GE\u2019s aerospace sales and orders both grew about 22% in 2023 compared with 2022. What\u2019s more, every engine GE sells needs to be serviced and cared for. That aftermarket business accounted for 70% of Aerospace\u2019s $32 billion in sales in 2023, and is more profitable than selling new equipment. Wall Street expects operating profit margins to expand by about two percentage points over the coming few years, up from about 19% in 2023, as new engines start to hit the shop for scheduled maintenance. That business should help Ebitda. hit about $8 billion in 2024, up from $7.2 billion in 2023; it could reach $9 billion in 2025\n\nGE is still going to split between aerospace and the power generation business, Vernova. I\u2019m more interested in aero, but I feel it will run up until split and I\u2019ll basically buy 2 companies now at a discount and I can always divest power.\n\nThis isn\u2019t typically the kind of company I go for, but I think it has great potential and it\u2019s a famous US name that has hit the skids for\u2026a while now. And I think they got a compelling way forward, even if they lost the lightbulb monopoly.\n\n",

Please share.\n\nMy one really good idea for 2024 is General Electric. In q2 of 2024, the company will spin off Vernova, which comprises of GE power and renewables. After which, GE will be a standalone company focusing only on aerospace for commercial and defence industries. \n\nEveryone has forgotten how good this aerospace business is. Their install base is 41k commercial planes and 26k defense aircraft. \n\nServices as a percentage of backlog is 89% and 70% of revenue. Currently the profit margin is 18.3% because the newest engines like LEAP is loss-making and only after 7 years (in 2024 or 2025) they will start their first shop visit and the revenue and margins will start coming in. The margin expansion from LEAP will ensure that the business can grow.\n\n In the 2023 paris and dubai show, India, UAE signed big deals with BOEING &amp; Airbus of which a large chunk is powered by GE. When the rest of Asia comes on board, this will be the peak of recognition of this business. \n\nRight now, RTX and HON is being compared as a better \u201cvalue\u201d because of a lower P/E. As a standalone GE will command a premium because of its market share and higher margin services content. \n\n(Disclosure, I have been invested in GE since 2018 and saw huge gains since 2022 and this year it doubled, even after spinning off GE medical )\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nOh and here is a kicker: if the Chinese c919 ever makes it into production (they have so far only produced four), guess what engine it is using? Yup GE",

For the a long time there was not really a good model to explain how to price options .\n\nNow some people did find an option pricing model and based on this started buying options they thought were priced too low and selling options priced too high and they made large outsized returns, however they never published their model . \n\nHowever later 3 economists published the Black-Scholes options pricing model and once they did that guess what, everyone now sort of knew how to price an option\n\nBecause of this the people who where once making outsized returns by buying mis-priced options no longer could, after black-scholes model was released and accepted less options were mispriced and this removed thier competive edge\n\nNow does all this prove or disprove the effecict maket hypothisis ? Maybe both, market inefficencies can exist, but if new iformation is release the market will quicky adjust and fix these inefficencies \n\nyour second point , return is return. I think its widely accepted that there is no reason to want return in the form of dividends or captial appreciation . The argument for dividends are usually just arguments for value stocks what you can argue for. I also think that one should not avoid dividends or only buy growth stocks. You should be agnostic and return=return\n\nYour 3rd point is true to, there are lots of investors who are good stock pickers but most people are bad at it, or if its worth the time and effort\n\nLets say you are a good stock picker, and you can \"beat the market\" by 2% points. Meaning if the S&amp;P500 goes up 10% in a given year buy stock picking you can make 12%. Pretty good investor\n\nHowever to do this you need to do a bunch of fundimental analsis pour over earnings reports , company filings, do your own DCA analsis and reseach the company and competitors. All this takes hours and hours. Like 10 hours a week\n\nIf you have 100k to invest , well your returns with zero effort just buying an index fund  might be 10k, by stock picking you would earn 12k\n\nSO your extra work for 520 hours netted you 2k, this equals out to like $4 an hour. And all this assumes you are like one of the best stock pickers in history.\n\nNow if you had 10 million to invest it might be worth it.",

I've heard horror stories of funds being transferred to another broker to keep them in a \"non-active employee plan\" that took hours of phone calls to prove identity/ownership of the account.

        "title": "Risks of investing in ETP (Exchange Traded Products) compared to CFDs and futures?",
        "selftext": "Update: After reading some articles and examples Daily ETP have Stop-Loss in them unfortunately... This means that long ETP would trigger a SL if the underlying stock drops \\~16.6% in a single day. So that's how the ETP originators earn money.  \n\nHello Everyone,\n\nWhy are retail traders not completely ignoring CFD trades and going all in on low priced leveraged ETPs (pennies)?\n\nExample is GraniteShares 3x Long AMD Daily ETC (3LAM.L) currently just 2.74$\n\nWe all know that chances are AMD will be more valuable in a year compared to now, as the AI hype wouldn't die in a year. There is too much market share to be taken away from Nvidia and the market doesn't even have too - the demand is currently way higher than the supply, so it's only a plus! The issue with futures and CFDs are that you pay fees, have stop loss and need to know very precisely how much and in which direction the market will move between the opening and closing of your position. With ETP you don't care, as you don't have daily fees or stop loss and inflation is your friend, as generally more money will be put into the profitable stocks sooner or later due to rising expenses and thus prices.\n\nThis ETP has made 20.1% in a day while AMD 5.25%\n\nThe NVDA equivalent has made from 6$ to 150$ in just a year. Using x5 leverage maybe could provide that return, but at a MASSIVE risk. How likely was it to lose money from NVDA 1 year ago by buying this ETP at just 6$? Similar ETPs for the other tech companies are already trading at far higher ranges than just 2-3$.\n\nFor some reason this Google ETP 3LAL hasn't reach it's ATH although currently GOOG is trading around ATH. I guess it has to do with when the ETP starts trading on the market or maybe it doesn't monitor stock splits/dillutions.\n\nI am wondering who is on the other sides of those ETP trades? You cannot convince me that people are shorting 3LAM while it's at a silly 2.74$ (was around 0.3$ when AMD was 80$) and AMD just recently started it's AI hyped bull run. Sure it already made around 300% in a year, but so did NVDA and AMD started from way lower market cap! I was actually shorting NVDA around 500-600$ range, as I didn't do any due diligence on it's main product behind everything :( - the Tensor A100 and how many orders were for it etc.\n\nPlease try to give me arguments why 3LAM would be a bad investment to buy and hold for 1 year if AMD - besides AMD getting priced less than 202$ per share? The fees is around 0.3% per trade without any daily fees from what I could tell.\n\nAnother example is 3LVW if you think Volkswagen will recover (I do) :). It has massive debt, but pays 8% in dividends.\n\nDisclaimer - I put have put my money where my mouth is, but I stay open to corrections about my understandings, as I have been proven very wrong recently about AMZN and why it's valued this high.\n\nWhy is math not working in some cases? Microstrategy did around x10 increase in a single year. The ETP did around 10 000 times increase?!\n\n3LMI went from 0.01$ to 337.71$ - it seems like the starting price is the biggest factor, as this is not just x30 times increase (due to the x3 leverage), but an insane 3 377 000% - good luck for any crypto to beat that!\n\nI couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc.",

Either that or China will destroy any hopes that have left for stock investments coming from abroad and USA especially. Why buy it at 74$ when I can buy it at 0.10$ and just wait 1 year for unknown range x30-30000 returns, by just risking 1000 euros, instead of waiting for it to reach it's old ATH (x5 current price) for at least several years?\n\nI already traded BABA with leverage and suffered a lot of losses due to fees, volatility and stop-loss. ETP bypasses all those risks. The only risk is Baba going to zero which is possible with the unpredictable CCP, but the upside potential is totally worth it. I am just wondering if there is something I don't know about ETPs in general like contract expiry or delisting risks etc.",

                "body": "Timely question! I've been studying VUG, VTV, and VTI. (If you plot VTI and VOO, the delta between the two is very small over time, so I've been buying VTI). \n\nSelecting the right fund (in my view) is based on your time horizon and if you're planning to invest a lump sum or normal monthly contribution. If you're young and have a long runway before retirement, then do VUG and VTI (or VOO if you like). \n\nIf you're close to retirement or retired, I would limit VUG (unless we have a major dip and you're able to buy at a discount). Your allocation should be VTI and VTV.  VTV is more of a value fund. \n\nIf you have a large lump sum then it is a bit different than DCA of monthly contribution. I think stocks are expensive (24x as of this week, historically it has been around 16x). So you can start with VTV and if the market sees a major dip in 2024, VTV does not go down as much as VTI. So at that point, you can switch some funds from VTV to VTI. This way you're participating in the market up or down.\n\nYou'll get folks on this sub suggesting something other than VTV (some would suggest SCHD). There is no wrong answer here... Each view is valid, you have to do your own analysis. (plot multiple ETFs you like in Yahoo finance plotter and compare). Good luck.",
