        "title": "McDonald's to sell Krispy Kreme doughnuts nationwide by the end of 2026",
        "selftext": "McDonald\u2019s is planning to sell Krispy Kreme doughnuts at its restaurants nationwide by the end of 2026, the chains announced Tuesday.\n\nThe rollout will start in the second half of this year, but it will take roughly two and a half years as Krispy Kreme more than doubles its distribution to satisfy the partnership. For the duration of the agreement, McDonald\u2019s will be the exclusive fast-food partner for Krispy Kreme in the U.S.\n\nThe doughnut chain uses a \u201chub and spoke\u201d model that lets it make and distribute its treats efficiently. Production hubs, which are either stores or doughnut factories, send off freshly made doughnuts every day to retail locations such as grocery stores and gas stations.\n\nThe partnership with McDonald\u2019s is a major opportunity for Krispy Kreme to expand its reach. It delivers its doughnuts to 6,800 third-party stores, as of Dec. 31. McDonald\u2019s has roughly 13,500 restaurants in the U.S. and plans to open 900 new locations nationwide by 2027.\n\n\u201cWe think we can service about 6,000 restaurants with our existing infrastructure, mostly doughnut shops, which have excess capacity,\u201d Krispy Kreme CEO Josh Charlesworth told CNBC.\n\nKrispy Kreme has also been expanding its capacity so it can deliver fresh doughnuts to the roughly 7,500 McDonald\u2019s restaurants that it can\u2019t currently reach.\n\nWhile McDonald\u2019s is the primary reason the company is expanding its distribution so quickly, Charlesworth said Krispy Kreme will also be using the opportunity to land in grocery and convenience stores that prefer national suppliers.\n\n\u201cThat means that the overall efficiency and productivity of our distribution network will significantly improve over time, not just because of all those local deliveries,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditionally, Krispy Kreme\u2019s doughnut shops typically make more of the sweet treat than the chain can sell. The extra demand from McDonald\u2019s and other new customers means its production lines can churn out higher volume with few additional costs.\n\n\u201cOverall, therefore, it makes our system more profitable to grow the deliver fresh daily channel, and McDonald\u2019s is an accelerator of that,\u201d Charlesworth said.\n\nThe two chains\u2019 relationship started about a year and a half ago, when McDonald\u2019s began selling Krispy Kreme doughnuts at nine restaurants as a test. Months later, the pilot had expanded to roughly 160 restaurants across Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. Those initial restaurants will keep selling the doughnuts during the national rollout.\n\nDemand from McDonald\u2019s customers during the tests exceeded both chains\u2019 expectations, according to Charlesworth.\n\nFor McDonald\u2019s, the addition of Krispy Kreme doughnuts helps bolster its bakery and breakfast offerings. The burger chain has been leaning into coffee, a common drink pairing for doughnuts, but trimming other bakery items such as cinnamon rolls from its menu.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s customers will be able to order the original glazed, chocolate iced with sprinkles and chocolate iced cream-filled doughnuts, either individually or in packs of six. The restaurants will sell the doughnuts all day.\n\nIn the long term, Krispy Kreme now expects it can reach more than 100,000 points of access for its doughnuts globally, up from its prior outlook of 75,000 locations. The chain\u2019s doughnuts can currently be found in more than 14,100 stores across 39 countries.\n\nShares of Krispy Kreme have fallen 20% over the past year, dragging its market value down to $2.11 billion. As hype over weight loss drugs such as Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic has soared, investors have worried about whether the treatments will cut into Krispy Kreme\u2019s future sales.\n\nSimilar concerns have weighed on McDonald\u2019s, although its stock has risen 2% in the past year as consumers trade down to its cheap food and drinks. The company has a market value of $201 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/26/mcdonalds-to-sell-krispy-kreme-doughnuts-nationwide-by-end-of-2026.html",

California is definitely getting the rollout first .  A donut-bun Quarter Pounder would end entire bloodlines . McDonald's will shrink in size, taste like shit, and be overpriced .  This is a direct response to California passing their new minimum wage law, with an exemption for any restaurant that sells bread or sells bread .

        "selftext": "  \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Options on Reddit drew a flurry of bullish bets on Monday as the social media platform's stock rallied as much as 16% after last week's strong market debut.  \nReddit shares soared 48% on the New York Stock Exchange as the company went public on Thursday, despite posting no annual profit since its launch in 2005.  \nOn Monday, Reddit was among the top gainers on the New York Stock Exchange, with the stock last up 15% at $53.01 in early afternoon trading.  \nSome 39,000 options traded by 1:10 p.m. (1710 GMT), with volume on pace to hit 62,000 contracts by the end of the day, Trade Alert data showed.  \nThe 2012 listing of options on Facebook Inc, now known as Meta Platforms, holds the record for the most active options market debut with some 360,000 contracts changing hands on the first day of trading.  \nReddit options buyers leaned toward bullish bets, analysts said.  \n\"The action is on the call side and collected around the upside,\" said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories. \"With the stock trading higher on Day One, this feels like speculation for higher moves.\"  \nApril call options with strike prices of $50 to $75 were among the most actively traded Reddit contracts. Among puts, contracts guarding against a drop below $25 by mid-April were the most traded.  \nCalls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future, while puts offer the right to sell them at a set price.  \n\"Reddit trading is reminding me of meme stocks,\" said Matt Amberson, founder of options analytics service ORATS, referring to stocks with viral popularity among individual investors who often use options to express their views.  \n\"Retail is in control and buying calls to the moon,\" Amberson said.  \nMeme stocks emerged in 2020, led by GameStop whose price rose as much as 100 times over several months in 2021, largely on the sentiment of individual buyers connected through the Reddit community forum WallStreetBets.  \nCommenters on Reddit's largest stock trading forums voiced skepticism about the long-term outlook for the money-losing company's shares.  \n\"Considering that Reddit can serve as a forum for individual investor speculation, it's no surprise that we see heavy buying of upside, near-term calls,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.  \n\"The fact that we're seeing so much activity in far out-of-the-money options \u2013 in both directions \u2013 tells me that speculators are driving the trading today,\" he said.  \n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Megan Davies and Richard Chang)\n\n  \nSource: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-options-launch-draws-bulls-174113771.html  \n",

Reddit execx and employees can't sell until after release of financials in Q3 (so mid July I think)  It's just as likely to drop like a rock as it is to go up. It's not even a Meme stock (yet)... It's barely getting started. The problem with your logic is thinking any \"tech\" company that releases with a less than 10 billion market value is underpriced .  Market has not made sense  for many years, IPOs are  just a cash cows for CEO &amp; friends . It's far outpaced GDP growth, even accounting for inflation . People are just buying en masse, hoping it's the next Nvidia. They picked a good time for the ipo. The market today proves that. It will be an expensive lesson.  This does have the feel of GME rebooted, but I have no idea if it will go that way . The focal center of meme culture just became self aware on the NYSE .

        "selftext": " Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar upgraded the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and boosted his price target on shares to **$135 from the prior $95**. The move implies roughly 15% upside based on current trading levels of about **$120** a share.\n\nVenkateshwar argued better-than-expected free cash flow and earnings guidance, coupled with \"tactical tailwinds\" such as the Hollywood strikes, Hulu's consolidation, and cost cuts, have helped buoy investor confidence. \n\nMeanwhile, \"*the propensity among media investors to be long Disney, has resulted in the stock outperforming broader markets meaningfully thus far this year, at a pace faster than we anticipated*.\"\n\nThe stock has been on a tear since the start of the year, up more than **30%** compared to the S&amp;P 500's 10% rise over that same time period.\n\nIt's a significant turnaround for the company after its stock price hit multiyear lows last year. The media giant has been grappling with challenges that include a declining linear TV business, slower growth in its parks business, and losses in its streaming business. A heated proxy battle with activist investor Nelson Peltz has also clouded the company's outlook.\n\nBut Venkateshwar argued Disney's next phase \"*may be more impactful as a number of turnaround elements still remain work in progress and may manifest more in numbers starting next year*.\"\n\nIn his bull case, the analyst said **sooner-than-expected streaming profitability** could serve as a boon to the stock price.\n\n*\"We expect Disney streaming to break even potentially a quarter or two earlier than company guidance of Q4 2024*,\" he explained. \"*This is in part driven by the tailwinds from cost cuts over the last few quarters and recent price increases*.\"\n\nVenkateshwar said he believes Disney will likely achieve streaming margins \"*that are better than Netflix*,\" estimating potential margins in the **25% to 30% range**, \"*which is not too different from where linear margins today are*.\"\n\nOther \"*upside narrative surprises*\" could include **ESPN's** yet-to-be-announced streaming partners for its over-the-top service, set to debut sometime in fall 2025, in addition to a refocused attention on long-term **succession** plans post-proxy battle.\n\nConversely, the analyst's bear case calls out declining non-sports TV viewership as linear network revenue falls amid increased cord cutting. Streaming, although a potential positive, could also be a net negative if subscriber growth does not pick up and pricing headwinds hit revenue growth.\n\n*Source:* [*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-stock-upgraded-by-barclays-as-turnaround-plan-takes-shape-155209507.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-stock-upgraded-by-barclays-as-turnaround-plan-takes-shape-155209507.html)",

If a call strike is above current share price then there is no intrinsic value . No one would exercise those calls and buy NVDA for that strike when they could buy it at market price .  The price of the option contract has moved as the stock moved, options pricing is based on the greeks, which change as the price changes hence why you are in profit even though the call is OTM presently .  In rough terms Delta is how much the option will increase in price as it goes closer to or further in the money . Theta is how fast the option's Delta will decay over time . To get big call movements, you would want to get far OTM calls .  Call options with strike prices that are closer to the current market price of NVIDIA stock (950 calls) generally have higher intrinsic value than call options that are farther away from the current price (945 calls) 950 call options may show higher profits even if the price of the stock fluctuates similarly .

Trian is officially recommending shareholders vote for Peltz and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and to withhold votes for Disney nominees Maria Elena Lagomasino and Michael Froman, who are current board members.\r  \n\r  \nTrian owns a relatively small position in Disney, representing about **1.5%** of the outstanding shares when combined with the ownership position of former Marvel Entertainment Chairman and CEO Ike Perlmutter, who has sided with Peltz in the proxy battle.\r  \n\r  \nThe Disney board meeting will be held April 3, and Trian could change its vote between now and then.\n\n***Source***: *https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/nelson-peltz-withholds-votes-from-disney-ceo-bob-iger-in-proxy-battle.html*",

It is also the first plant based meat company to meet the American Diabetes Association\u2019s evidence-based nutritional guidelines.\n\n2 - The company has gone through restructuring and cost cutting over the past year and 2024 is when it will begin to materialize. They\u2019ve forecasted moving from a negative gross margin to positive mid-high single digit gross margin by end of year.\n\n3 - The company recently announced 250mm shelf offering. Normally this would be negative news, however this eliminates the risk of bankruptcy and the market now knows how much capital maybe raised over the upcoming year(s).\n\n4 - Demand has been declining in United States. The company is shifting the narrative from meat replacement to the healthy benefits of the plant based alternative. This along with the ADA label may help re-spark consumer interest.\n\nIn Europe, sales have been rising and continue to be a strong market.\n\n5 - Generally, demand is greater during the U.S. summer grilling season.

Google is inherent anti consumer as they make their profits on data capture .  The FBI wanted Apple to install a backdoor in all future iOS versions, which Apple refused to do . The FBI cracked it even without Apples help .  Apple tricked many of its users (like OP) into believing that their closed, anti-consumer ecosystem is better for you . It's one of my biggest positions with an iPhone, but from an investor perspective, its harder to make money off you . I think Apple will take a similar approach to Gen AI .  Apple already has 61% market share in the US . The big international markets like India and China are more or less impenetrable for Apple . But people will die apple users over switching to anything else, its a cult following basically .  Apple is an aggressive, sinister, and cutthroat company in the way it treats both consumers and developers, but at the end of the day, you can't say it hasn't been good for their bottom line . As long as Apple holds a majority stake in the most important hardware market, developers will still write for it .  Apple is probably a hold, especially if you are going to take the tax hit by selling, but it's probably trading sideways for the next year . The only major advantage they have is consistency in devices compared to Android .  The real answer is that we have no idea how much data Apple has on its users . Apple can protect its universe of user data and buy what it wants with its very deep pockets / cash / cash .  Apple will find a way to do AI without needing users to surrender their data like everyone else . The flipside is their greatest asset with Chinese consumers who are under social credit scrutiny and the USA who are afraid of China getting their info .",

ChatGPT is really bad about making stuff up in niche applications where some data exists but not a lot .  When the button is clicked, it will display a message box saying \"Hello, World!\" The script does the following: Imports necessary classes from the .NET Framework (`SystemWindows.Forms` for GUI components and `System.Drawing` for size and location properties) Defines a class `MyForm` that inherits from `Form,' representing the main window .

Reddit will be dead and you're left holding your bags by 2026 . This will kill most content on the platform . But the reality is the company doesn\u2019t make any money . They have 800 million in revenue last year at 80% margin .  Reddit is one of the largest and longest living social media platforms alive currently and it is JUST going public . Theres no way it hovers around $40-50 for several years . Reddit also doesn't value it's own data so much .

My account value was up $4.4 million for 11 minutes before it was corrected . Schwab has the borrowing rate to short DJT at 184%.  First time option trade, but could have been another 1k in my pocket... I was trying to sell when the price hit 79. Ended up selling at around 71 on the phone . I still feel comfortable saying screw Robinhood. I got screwed by 20k+ when they paused GME .  The stock is trading on hype right now so you can make gains if you time it right . It's trading off the fact that \"the base\" will literally bleed themselves to make the price go up . There are further waves of dilution to come in the following months .  When do you think would be a good time to get puts on DJT? And at what strike price? The question is does Trump leave his people as bag holders before or after the election? Earliest he can sell is September I think . The DJT board can potentially waive his lockup at any time . Summarization not available for this chunk.  Wealthsimple hasn't updated the options yet so everyone holding them can\u2019t sell until they do . Wealthsimple said it will be mid day before I can sell to close my options\u2026 But may be a blessing in disguise .  The market is going to zero, it's not a question of if this dogshit company will go to zero. It's a matter of when. The market will not hold long term though. I made money but I missed out on so so much more money.",

Every four years, the Bitcoin network experiences an event known as the \u201cHalving\u201d The fourth Bitcoin halving is set to happen on April 19th, 2024 . The halving isn't reducing the available coins, it's reducing the rate at which they are created .  I did want to invest in some stocks and keep them for at least 15-20 years . Can you guys name some good value stocks? Both high and low risk ones would be much appreciated .",

Would it ever make sense to sell a chunk to rebalance it to a lower percentage? Just wondering what the general consensus is? I look at blue chips like this as real estate and try and stick to the \"never sell\" mentality, but always open to learning and hearing what others think and do :) TIA!",

Let alone, if you hold Coinbase stock or bitcoin in the long term, a hedge might do you well. \n\nLet\u2019s chat! ",

        "summarized_comments": " Bitcoin halving is soon, and that usually triggers a bull run in crypto for a few months . If you buy puts expect to lose that bet but at least there is limited downside risk . Bitcoin is already priced in, and the halving will do nothing and then they will move on to new story to hype it up .  It seems as if the crypto bull run has just began, but there are a lot of reasons to believe it will be a thing . With that said, it's definitely going up, until the euphoria in the markets goes back down . The company just isn't that good, and it\u2019s run by a guy who really isn\u2019t all that smart .",
